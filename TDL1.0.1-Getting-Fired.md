# Getting fired

Rob: When I was 15 I got my very first job and it was the result of my friend Doug looking in the local newspaper and seeing that the YMCA was hiring lifeguards. 

So I decided "what the heck", I was on the swim team and, well, being a life guard would be kinda cool. So we payed 30 dollars down at the YMCA, took the Water Safety Instructor Course so we could become lifeguards. 

In our mind, we saw a lot of women running around in bikinis, while we, studly lifeguards, sat in the towers with our sunglasses on smiling down at them. You know, the perfect 16 year old male plan. Why not?

Well, what it turned out to be is the YMCA where we got the certification from actually hired us and, you know, we were excited about that. It was my very first job, but what I ended up doing was watching old people swim laps.

[Musical interlude]

So being a lifeguard is pretty boring as you can imagine. I mean, you sit there and watch people swim. That's all you do: You sit in a chair, you blow your whistle and yell at them, basically. But when it's old people swimming there is no yelling. There is nothing to do. You sit in a chair, all day long.

So, to stem the boredom I decided to bring a book. After a while reading books while watching the pool, out boring in and of it self, so I decided to have some friends come over. They came and hang out with me. Fortunately they brought beer, and, well, other things.

So as you might imagine if you're a member of the YMCA, or any club for that matter, and you look up and your lifeguard is carrying on with his or her friends back in the lifeguard office drinking beers and smoking cigarettes watching you swim, well, you might get kind of upset. 

That's what my boss told me at least, and I tried to understand, tried to understand in my 15 year old mind when she looked at me and said: "So we're gonna let you go." And I remember rolling that phrase around in my mind. It was the first time I ever heard it. "Gonna let me go," and I just looked back at her and said: "I don't really wanna go. Thank you, though, I appreciate it, but I need this job."

[Musical interlude]

I remember the look on her face was just priceless. She looked at me with a look of pitty, looked like she wanted to give me a hug, and a look of distain. I'm not sure how you can mix all that together, but she managed it.

She said: "No, see, what I'm actually trying to tell you is, you're fired." I just stared back at her. I remember at the time the line from the Jetsons going through my head where Mr Spacely yells at George: "Jetson, you're fired."

So this started at the start of my shift, and, no one was there to pick me up. I couldn't drive yet, as I had mentioned I had my permit. You don't actually get your license in California untill you're 16 and I was only 15. 

The good news was it was only a halve a mile or three quarters of a mile away from my house, so I walked home. And I remember being tortured the entire way home if the girls in the bikinis in my mind staring at me and laughing. Big strapping lifeguards don't get fired.

# Opening

Rob: Welcome to the opening episode of This Developers Life. And with this podcast, I'm sort of following in the footsteps of This American Life. What I want to do is, show more of a human side of the technology industry.

My goal is to talk to developers and technology people of all shapes and sizes, of all camps, and bring about the human side of their stories.

And so this week I thought I'd start off with, I suppose, a, well, a bit of a dark topic about getting fired. And I should probably explain why I picked that topic. It's because whenever I start a new venture, it could be a new relationship with a friend or it could be buying a car, maybe a new job, I was wondering how it's going to end.

And in a way, thinking about the end somehow allows me to come to terms with the idea that the venture that I'm doing is not really permanent, at least, not in a grand universal sense, nothing's really permanent. So I thought, shoot, why not think about the end of things. We might as well discuss getting fired. 

So to start things off, I have two story tellers, and then one story from myself. The first is a Microsoft developer.

Sarah J. Chipps: The first time I'd ever gotten fired I definitely deserved it.

R: Sarah J. Chipps, Microsoft developer, currently lives in New York, leads the Girl Develop It program and has a blog up at [girldevelopit.com](http://girldevelopit.com/). She leads things of for us today.

S: One of my first jobs was with a company, I will call them a home depot for contractors. It was a family owned business that had kind of taken off and expanded and now they had about thirty stores or so over this area. And they had a monster data warehouse. 

Their data warehouse consisted of more then maybe 200 tables. Maybe two or three dozen of them actually contained data that was relevant to anything. There were a ton of tables that were called test4 and table_steve_temporary and like all kinds of stuff that has been around for about ten years. And it had just kind of evolved with all these different data warehouse people coming in and leaving. 

They had a high turnover rate because the guy that ran the technical department was part of the original family that had started the business. Everyone was really afraid of him because if he got angry, everyone would definitely feel his wrath.

No matter, no matter who you are. It was just kind of thrown in your direction. I never really have to deal with him at all. You know being I was just a lonely DBA. 

And we every week would consist of I don't know few; I believe it's called Cognos. That's what there POS system using, Cognos.

And every day over night Cognos would export all its data , as we are using SQL server. And at time there no pain-less way to go from Cognos to SQL server. So, over night it export all the data to text files. And we use one that programs which take all data and deliminator-ed correctly based on spacing and pull it to SQL. 

Most of the times consisted of coming and see what all data didn't make it. Figuring out why and putting out condition for that particular case and then making sure the data came over. Every weekend this report was run for the head of the company, the guy the contracting home depo whatever the name is. It was his report and it will give him sales for weekend. Sales for previous week and numbers growth, you know stuff like that.

And this one week

R: So you know what's coming here. Every story about bad news always starts with 'and this one time' it is worth to set a stage a little more; in case you don't know who is Sara J. Chipps is? She is very enterprising your lady. She is very in to enabling woman into development. She has girl developer program. She is very community oriented, in-fact she sits on lots of panels; gets asked a lot of questions about woman in technology. To say this she is very bright and very motivated, although it bit of understatement. So here she is working in this company, where all that she asking how to do, is tweaks some data; she is DBA. If any reporting data comes out wrong or didn't parsed correctly. Well then she got to go back and tweak it. If anybody out there ever worked  Business Intelligence arena probably know the tool Cognos. Its not terribly easy to use and you usually if you have to change something you have to do it through some XML transforms. So that's Sara's job, so any back to her story back to her story. And, this one time.

S: My boss is away and she asked me that if I can make sure to kick off the report. She need me to manually kick off this report to run. At like Friday 5 o'clock.

R: Friday 5 o'clock ??!!! Very important business report that you have to run manually. Congos!!! What in the world could go here??!!

[Musical interlude]

S: So, I don't know, what, what made me not think of it. I am sure, I am pretty much sure I was thing about beach or may be my own way to beach or something like that. 

[Musical interlude]

S: But I completely forgot to kick off this report at 5 o'clock. Entire weekend went by and I never think of it. It is one of the thing when you come to office that Monday and you see everyone's face (laughing!!!). 

[Musical interlude]

R: Whooops!!! Well it happens. People forget stuff. I forget stuff. Everyone does. Unfortunately for Sara forgetting to run a report make the manager to that company didn't have the sales figure, didn't have the stuff they kind needed. Ya its kind of big mess and poor Sara was shown the door. The interesting thing to me when I was talking to Sara at the time; was that they waited until the day to tell her. And I said you look into office like people looking at you and you get "Sara you are busted", she said that well I let her tell you

S: I came in at 10, like usually you know there is a shift that started at 8, so they defiantly coming at 8 and seeing what was going on and experienced the wrath and fear of "ohh my ghoss that report never happen". It wasn't like you run the report and and get by Monday after noon. If you kicked them off Monday morning then you will get by Tuesday or like that.  So, it was like delayed for couple of days. I show my boss's face and I was like it hit me. And her and I am pretty close. she is actually wonderful lady. And I remember looking at her, "Oh my god I can't believe I forgot to do that". And she was, like you could say she fell horrible for me. Sure she took some responsibility for having me do it or something. In fact she was crying, she cried  when she gave me the news. It was very emotional for both of us.

[Musical interlude]

R: It was always fun to recon stories about earlier jobs in our life. Or sometimes its funny how that job ended. In my case I got axed for being lame and Sara got axed for forgetting something rather important. Sometimes these stories aren't always funny. And in the course of taking to Sara for this show she mentioned second story to me. She says actually this is one little bit more serious. Lets kind of heard.

[Musical interlude]

R: You actually have two stories. 

S: I do actually have two stories. The second one was, so ... after the...

R: I just notice by the way your voice dropped in octave so this is gone be juicy one

S: [Laughing with mix feelings] This very interesting story and probably one of the defining moment of my career. To tell you the truth. The company I went to work with after the big home depo for contractors. They ended up getting but sheers, kind of hostile taken over and development team got outsource. So, I was back to looking for work. And, I show this. I was doing some contract work for British Telecom. I really wasn't very happy. I show some cool list in Craig's list. Look like something pretty neat. It was just basically like; cool part of listing is it was fun group and they need someone to do web development thing. It is kind of really abstract. It wasn't very depth in it. I was just reached out and guy called me in and talk to me on phone when he told me what the job was;

There was a magazine and he wanted to put together, it was pretty much, if I say reflection of very large scale CMS. And he wanted one developer to do it. And I have never worked by my self on project before. You know like this is, I relatively new to web development, I was doing it for little over two years so I just didn't really feel prepared to do something like this.

So, I said thank you very much. But, I really don't thing I am qualify to do this. 


[Musical interlude]

S: And the guy was like; We call him Steve. So, Steve was like see honestly I love your personality please come in let me just talk to you. You know whatever; you know seriously I can not do this. I am not qualified to do this. 

R: So, basically he is begging you to do the work. 


[Musical interlude]

S: Right. So, I went in and talked to him. I was honestly, we got along really well. Like personality wise it is really a fun group. They work for six week at a  time and took two weeks off. 


[Musical interlude]

R: So, Sara takes the job. As you could probably guess. Decides to why not??!!! I ll build the CMS, I ll do it by my self. She gets into it, wouldn't you???

S: what a worst thing even can happen??? So,I really kind of put my all into this. And you know immediately I decide everything I ll do agile. I had put my agile wall up. You know I m the only developer but for this all, but whole wall up there and I put day putting all this wall together with my days and my cards. I made my cards and put together this all schema and I made this big display; what the database schema is gone a look like.


[Musical interlude]

S: Took about 5 months. 

R: So, Sara spend 5 months building a application she didn't feel she was capable of building at first place. She really didn't wanna a do it. When offered her a job, she said no.  No I don't want to do this. I don't have a skills to do this. And she ended up doing it any way. And she builds an application she told me basically defined her. She put in ton of functionality; blog and every kind of CMS type of things. Imagine changing text, image, color all kind of stuff. Its lot of work over 5 months. She was proud of it.

S: Upload a article and there was friend's component more like like component between businesses and all. I think they still have the application to this date. 


[Musical interlude]

S: So, towards like past last 3 months, I was working 90-100 hours a week. I was sleeping in the office. Like this is my child, this is my defining moment, right? And I was gonna do this; no matter what. Family and friends calling me like where are you? what happens to you? and whatever. And I told this is part of software, and you have to sacrifices, so I did. 

One morning after spending most of my weekend, again working on this. I went in working one morning. I could tell that Steve I was working for was kind looking for stuff to find; there was wrong with like we can change this and we can change that. And to tell you at this I was kind exhausted and you know. But its towards the end, end of tunnel little bit. So, he kind of said I am really disappointing in this and I am disappointing that how long it is taking you. 

And he was like you know I feel like this didn't get done fast enough. And to tell you the truth that we are loosing money and I can't afford to pay you more and I really disappointed in your work. 

It was devastating. It has been my life for past 5 months and I had put everything into it. Done my best and my best was very disappointing. And I went devastated isn't a right word. It was, I was tired and spent and heart broken. You know if you work on something that hard and I build something beautiful. I had done something, there I still look back on with pride when I look at it now. And it was not good. And it was disappointing. And it was a failure. And I  went home, just kind of collapse on my couch and literally stays there for about four days. Until Like rescue party came for me from the office. (Laughs)

[Musical interlude]

R: It happens when you got too close to work, you get really into what you build. You get start to ,oh for lack of better words obsessed a little bit. Take it on as your own, because you wanna build your creating. You are creating something special and when you identify that thing with your own professional abilities well; its when things tend to get little bit what I call specially with the manager of the project. So, I asked Sara. You think you got bit too close? You think your manager sense that you are getting too close that you are taking ownership of this?

S: I don't, I don't know to tell you the truth. He defiantly freaked out the days in the office that I was sitting there in same cloths. Before he look at my computer. I think towards the end there was lot, I wouldn't say head budding more I would say grading. You know what I mean. It like I was frustrated and he was frustrated. And you could tell in our meeting, that when he would ask for things and I like I would be, I finally learn the word NO. Probably 3 weeks before my last day. Finally learn; I never forget that he got so angry, that I said sorry that's not possible. It was not huge feature change, feature is already been added and he want me to make it different. It was about like 2-3 days of work. And I was like I am sorry, no it cant happen. It made him so.... 

Open to this point I never said anything like that, alright how will do that. Like every time he come to me something new, I ll be like OK, do some research; OK this how we ll gone do it and this what you gone a see. You know this is very, the whole thing. Like how much I learn. 

I learn better ways to say no, and I learned, and I also learned sneaky ways to say no. 

[Musical interlude]

R: Sara J Chipps has a blog of a girldeveloper.com many thanks for sharing your story with us today.

[Musical interlude]

R: Saying that you grow up here a lot. Its the best defense is good offense. Apparently as per our next story teller here that applies to job market as well. So, I talked to Oren Eini other wise known as Ayende Rahien about well times that he had been fired. 

Oren Eini : My clients think to pick me, mostly from the blog. I am known quantity. And type of things they suggest and type of thing we work and tend to be pretty fix. They already pretty much know what I am going to do and they brought all that actual implementation and whatever they doing for their software. To be able convince their bosses that something happens after he got. 

I think that is what happen. Because for most part this is not happen random. People are actually selecting me because they started going to argue for. 

R: For listener in audience who don't have any idea who is Ayende Rahine is? He is prominent blogger. He is quite a young guy leaves in Israel. He is fairly opinionated. And he is prolific with his blog post. Not only in the quantity of post he writes but also in depth and the quality. You have to look preety hard to find a guy well as well verse in Microsoft Technology as Ayende is. He is hired by Microsoft to come in and critic their efforts. And hired by government and all kind of folks to come in and help out. So, Ayende says when people seek him out he is telling the exact truth but Oren has not been fired. Which I actually found  to be a little  bit amusing, when you spend anytime talking to Oren. You found out quickly that he is a passionate guy. And not only that but he is quite forth right. Like someone says on your face with his beliefs to the point where he doesn't care who is talking to could be client, manager whatever. He is going to tell his opinion which to me seems like the perfect set of ingredients to be shown the door. Turns out that it never happened that way. 

O: I would question why getting fired at such a high priority. Let me tell a story from while ago. I spent four years in prison. That palls for the listeners to their horrified expression. I really, I really like to see that kind of expression, specially in job interviews. Its fun. 

I spent four years as prison commander. Well every team from the prison guard to a prison commander. And I really didn't like that. You know prison is really really depressing?!!! Even if you on the side of you can walk out of the door at any time. The problem is part of my army service. Well I could walk out of the door for smoke or a cafeteria stuff like that. I couldn't mentally just walk out. I couldn't harmonize ignition and couldn't just walk away.

[Musical interlude]

O: After four years. It came that you can walk away stuff... Do you know what was my main criteria for finally civilian job? Any thing that I can work away if it not present. And in 2008 I had various personal project and I went to my senior. See I am not ever going to use this technology. It is too painful. And he say no we made strategic decision that all of our project going to use this technology. In that case my strategic decision is to avoid pain... Good Bye.

A month later I offer my own part. And that was something, incredibly important to me. Before I was able to walk away from the situation that is painful. Painful from all perspective because that software was crap. That means that I was saying in the end you probably work with some piece of software that incredibly frustrating. Being fired usually is a indication that I am avoiding pain some sort of pain.Now I have people tell me ok, we had ok, we had done. Ok fine this is your pay check. And we wont meet again. I couldn't emphasize that how this means important to my mental health. To really just walk out. 

A lot things I was doing. Done explicitly in a way that they will be able to that they have choice of doing X or Y if they wanted to.

[Musical interlude]

R: You can read about Oren Eini and his musings on life on his blog. [http://ayende.com/blog](http://ayende.com/blog)

[Musical interlude]

R: Next step is my turn. And I think I could share a story with you. I decided to end title of koyote contract. What happens when you get into situation working on a contract where there is no way out. Except but cut of your own hand.

[Musical interlude]

R: While back I picked up a contract based on recommendation of good friend. Was really good company that he recommended, in turn he recommended me to them. And don't normally like to work with friends. Well, however I worked with this person before. And I really like him and worked we had done together. Its more over technology I really thought I need and I need to work more over it. And finally one of the main reason of doing stuff like this is I needed the money.  So, we came together one day and set down. Do the meeting and I got to meet people my friend work with. The meeting was went pretty well for the most part, except from two main  things. I was just stuck at the side in my head if you will. 

The first he describe the project to me. They told me about main bit of intellectual property, IP as they say, with what I ll working with. It is sort of core of entire site. The algorithm as we called it. And I said well it sounds out standing. Sounds like really interesting thing. I can't really wait to actually throw some data and get it to work. And they say actually you are gone a be working with it. And I said oh great, I sign in NDA. When we I get to do? Its exiting. They say, NO you don't understand. You are building it. 

[Musical interlude]

R: I remember at the time thinking, this is the IP of your client's project and I am going to build it??!!! Ok, well. Hmmmm I can probably do that. Well I don't know C++(C plus plus) and some other deeper languages I need to complete this. But if you give me the specs I ll do what I can. And they say NO you dont understand. You are going build it entirely. 

[Musical interlude]

R: I realized that at that point probably I should have shaken hands and got up and walk away. 

[Musical interlude]

R: Well, I decided I misunderstood something. Lets just move on. The idea is sort of stuck in my head like bit of splinter. But then I decided why not, lets move on. 

The next conversation was with the business person who arrange the contracts at the company. And person said to me first thing forbade, its very nice to meet you. That you should realize that we were going to out source your position and I am hopping your that rates will be commends rate with something I could find off shore somewhere. Is that going to be problem for you? 

[Musical interlude]

R: You know, Believe it or not. I am use to this cheese bombs from whenever from companies. It does happens. So, instead of discussing what I usually do. I said look I work within your budget. I prefer not to do an hourly thing. Mostly base things on delivery of scope. So, I was sure I can come to interview on scope. Normally I would walk away from this job. I would walked away in seconds. But I didn't. Because of this three factors. A friend of mine with whom I wanted to work with, I needed the money and this is some fine technology I wanted to work with.  So, I said my that I can figure this out. I can figure this out. 

[Musical interlude]

R: Oh boy with the details you can probably fill in the gaps. When you got to work with the project manager from 1998, you know the guys came in to all dot come boom from fortune 50 companies. Thinking of that because they could run IT or another group with a small bit of technical discipline they could tackle start up life and software development. 

I got the 5 PM Friday calls, demo on Monday. All by the way I need you to add these 5 pieces to scope and I trust  you can complete them. This you know, I need this buddy. 

[Musical interlude]

R: They refuse to talk to their own client. I said every time we talk our client they add scope to the work. If we talk to them they add scope and then we gonna add on to yours. You want that to happen??? Neither do I??? Right !!!

[Musical interlude]

R: So, finally you got to the point where I did the only thing, that was possible. Because scope was changing  to point where it kind of life of its own. And we all deal with creeping scope. And I am a professional, I manage these things. It wasn't a matter of saying hey listen Mr.Client person, you can have this and that. And starting to talk about time. We can even getting more agile. They were running project, I was just a developer. They were also creating the IP. 

Was a not good place to be, and I knew it, I knew it the entire time. But call it pride, call it desire, call it whatever you will. I decided I stick to this through. I kept thinking to my self; look you were doing this from twenty plus years, you should be able to fix this ship that is sinking. You should be able to right this and make all happen.

Well lets call that pride. I thought I could do it. I clearly could not. 

[Musical interlude]

R: So, I though well, see if they can settle up for this first bit of scope of that contract I wrote. So, I send him a letter and said hey, could we see could settle up this scope and then move on. Its been three and half months. 

They said with no politeness; sure what you think is finished? 

And so I lay down a long list. I realized, yaiks!!! there is a lot of things that I did do that weren't in the scope. Its a lot of things that I did do that got run away. I realized exactly where this discussion is gonna go. And I was right when they came back decided to settle on their own terms. Decided to give me half and I took it. I said ok. I just wanna out. 

[Musical interlude]

R: I could have avoided whole this. I know that. This probably the worst part of the whole thing for me. I knew it at very first meeting. I knew it First month, second month, first week throw the twelve. I knew the entire time but I kept believing in my self. Call that pride if you will. Call that hubris. May be I was being arrogant. May be I felt like I could do more than possible I could. But I kept feeling that I had the number of years of experience that I could put that to use and I could deliver against all odds. It is something that I prided my self doing for a long time. And in this case I lost. It was very bitter pill to swallow. Financially and otherwise. But I took the financial hit as penalty, penalty for not walking when I should have. 

Someone say - isn't kind of penalty for believing in your self? Ya, it could be. I see as a penalty of being little bit too proud.
