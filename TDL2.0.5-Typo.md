### Typo

Geoffrey: I used to subscribe to a magazine called Metropolis; which is more about architecture but they also had this kind of variety of ideas in there. They had one font that was just absolutely beautiful, that I just thought, "Wow, this is amazing". The first time I saw it the headline was about George W. Bush and I just stared at that for literally twenty or thirty minutes examining all the different letters. It was just incredible. I was like, that is the most amazing typeface that I've ever seen.

[Musical interlude]

Rob: That's Geoffrey Grosenbach once again, waxing poetic on fonts. 

G: It was kind of angular but it wasn't square. It has some kind of triangular ideas in there and yet the lines all looked like they were the same width. So everything just kind of looked straight. But in order to achieve that effect you actually have to make things thicker in some places and thinner when they join up with other lines. You have to do things to lines in order to make them look like they're straight and in fact they're not. They're bending in at different points or something like that. The way they'd done that just looked really great.

So anyway I found this one and I used it for PeepCode. Well it turns out that the Facebook logo uses that font and now Comcast Xfinity, they use it, and actually I saw it in an ad for Sears. Oh no. I've definitely not chosen something kind of niche and hard to discover if Sears is using it.

[Musical interlude]

Scott: I was arguing with a friend of mine recently who loves metal. He loves metal music and I hate metal. And I don't know why he was born this one way and I was born another way. And it's the same thing with fonts. There's some people who love a certain font. They do their entire lives in Helvetica and there's other people who do their entire life in Comic Sans. But there's supposed to be a science behind it. It's an art form. Fonts affect people at an emotional level like art affects people.

And just as I don't understand art history and art criticism or have any idea what Roger Ebert is talking about when he talks about how Weekend At Bernie's is evocative of Truffaut's The 400 Blows. I'm sure that there's a science behind the font but I know I'm not supposed to use Arial.

There's this wonderful "So You Need A Typeface" flowchart that was created by a guy named Julian Hansen. And you basically start at the beginning and it says things like, "Did you cry when watching Terminator? Yes? Use OCR."

Rob: [Laughs] I like it.

S: "Do you have a lot of tables? Use Letter Gothic. Is it ok with you if the font is Swiss? Use Helvetica. Not afraid to be asked if you live in the 90's?" These are the kinds of questions that we ask ourselves when doing a font. But I do know this, you have to ask someone who knows about fonts.

Every time I try to dress myself, I fail. Every time I try to pick my own font, I fail. Ask an expert. There's a science here.

R: And so we did just that. After the Style interview we did with Geoffrey Grosenbach, I got into a discussion with him about  fonts. And I asked him directly, "What does a good font look like? What makes one more stylish or modern than another one?"

G: Yeah, that's a good question. I mean the word modern for anything, or contemporary, it's a relative term really. It changes as things go along and that's true in fashion for clothes or even programming. The kinds of languages we like to use or the syntax of languages. It's the same thing with types of fonts that people are choosing to look at or use. How do they determine what that is? I guess one could look at the history of how it all happened. People started with handwriting and calligraphy and then Gutenberg figured out, "Ok let's melt some metal and stamp this into paper." The first things they try to do just look like calligraphic handwriting and it was a while later that people thought, "Well, we're doing something completely different so let's come up with something that *looks* completely different and doesn't look like something you could easily achieve with a pen or a nib'ed ink pen or something like that." And yeah, then it goes on from there.

The kinds of things that most people like now, which is this Sans Serif font. That was because somebody was just being avant-garde and hacking the little feet and tails off of an existing Roman, kind of Times looking thing and it looked completely different. Now we think that's just normal. That's kind of the default of how we want stuff to look.

R: I'm not exactly a font person but I knew it when I saw it.

G: Right!

R: You look at this page and my eyes aren't bleeding when I read this text. And the headers make sense and it flows and you sort of feel it. You know what I'm saying? You *feel*, and I'm wondering if there's some kind of study that anyone has done where the curves of the font or the shapes strike some sort of, I don't know what, some sort of nerve in your brain or something. Do you know of anything like that? Is there a scientific reason why we like some fonts more than others for reading or for headings?

G: Well there's huge research into what's readable. The important thing is what condition. I actually went to a type design conference here in Seattle a couple years ago which I loved and I was like, "Oh I'm going to go to this every year", and I haven't gone since. But someday I will go to another one of their yearly conferences.

S: Wow. There's a conference for everybody. Wanna do some cosplay? There's a conference for that. Really like Helvetica? Let's go to the Red Line Inn. Everyone loves Garamond.

R: You ever seen that video from College Humor called Font Conference? 

S: Yes!

R: Take a listen.

[Start of video]

Times New Roman: Today we'll decide whether or not to offer membership to Zapf Dingbats.

Arial Narrow: No, Wingdings was bad enough. I'm sick of panderin' to these artsy farts.

Times New Roman: You should really expand your world view Arial Narrow.

[Break]

Times New Roman: Ransom! What are you doing here? 

Ransom: Come on, get with the times, New Roman. I know your system like the back of Lucida Grande. Just ask your friend, Courier. You have two minutes. For every minute after that Courier and Curls MT will lose one of their serifs.

Comic Sans: Not so fast Ransom!

Other voice: Comic Sans!

[Another voice singing] "Comic Sans the boldest of them all."

Arial Narrow: I hate you so much.

[End of video]

S: I thought that Baskerville really got a bum deal on that one. Why does no one respect Bodoni?

R: My favorite part of that whole clip was Century Gothic and unfortunately you couldn't hear it because there's nothing to hear. She was just sitting there as this Goth going, "Everyone I'm with is sheep. You're all conformists."

S: [Laughs] That's the Janeane Garofalo of fonts.

R: Exactly.

G: You know, they talked about all things from like fonts designed for highway signs and they actually tested it by putting water on it and looking at it in the dark and having reflective letters and they tried dozens, even hundreds of shapes to see what was going to be the easiest to read on a highway sign. "Exit Here", there's this or that street.

Georgia is interesting because that, probably why it looks good on a computer screen is because it was designed for a computer screen. It was actually, I believe Microsoft commissioned that from a famous type designer and they said, we want something that's - and this was like 1995 or something like that - we want something that look's good on 800x600 pixel screens and so it was specifically designed to look good on a screen. It wouldn't look as good if you printed it out necessarily because it wasn't designed, it wasn't targeted for that.

As far as the research, hooking into neurons in the brain and recognition of visual patterns or something - I'm sure somebody might be doing that but usually it's just they try a bunch of things, have a bunch of people look at it and figure out what's the easiest to read.

S: I made an argument today on my blog and I mistakingly, I misused O(N) notation.

R: Mmm-hmm.

S: And suddenly fifteen-hundred programmers that are also math geeks came around and just went bananas, right. You know, it's the same thing if you go and say a zero should have a slash through it. It's like the most political thing ever. It's like when did you stop beating your wife? Suddenly, "What?! What are you saying to me, how can you, how dare you!" You know there are few things more political than, well politics, and programmer fonts.

R: All it takes is for a web developer, like you or I, like you said before, to use Arial or something in a web design and look out - you will have people ripping you apart. What did I do? I just put a nice, what I thought was readable, font on my page. It's something, I just, I don't know what a good font is. I don't necessarily know what a bad font is…

S: There are few things in the world that will make you question  your breeding and your education more than a poor font choice. [Mocking] How dare you use Baskerville and Palatino in this context on the same sheet of paper!

R: But how do you know what a bad font is? Except when Gruber climbs all over you or someone says, Ohhhhh.

S: Only Comic Sans, all other fonts are allowable.

[Musical interlude]

G: You know I think a lot of it is like, how it's used. I mean one that I dislike happens to be Gotham by Hoefler & Frere-Jones. Not because it's a bad typeface, I think it's beautiful. I just think it's overused.

I was going to start a blog where I try to go for a month without seeing it three days in a row or something. And I can pretty much guarantee I would see Gotham somewhere on TV, in print, signs, the name of a building, whatever, at least every day or third day or something like that. It's just used everywhere, all over the place. You know, and it looks great and people are using it.

I think Comic Sans is - it's terrible to compare those two because they're completely different but - part of the reason people don't like Comic Sans or designers don't like Comic Sans is because it's used all over the place by all kinds of people who like the mood that it communicates. And maybe there's something else that would work better or be a little more refined or something like that.

[Musical interlude]

R: So I'm going to go ahead and say what Geoffrey won't. People that use Comic Sans are, I think, are people that wear acid wash and have no sense of what makes a good font good.

S: This from a man who wears hawaiian shirts and acid wash pants.

R: Well, I said before I didn't know what a bad font necessarily was but I'll tell you, you know if you really think about it what we're talking about with a good font is clean lines. It's readable, it's a pleasure to look at. So for instance, you know the font Papyrus?

S: Uh-huh. Yea it's kind of a specialized font, not something you'd use every day.

R: It's a tiki-ish thing and I've had so many friends think, "Oh I'm going to be clever and use Papyrus." It's just every time I see it it makes me wanna groan. It's horrible. But a great font, nice clean one, is Helvetica. Which everyone knows. Speaking of, you know that movie, Helvetica?

S: Right, there's a fantastic documentary, an entire movie two hours long about Helvetica. Not about fonts, no, about Helvetica itself. It's great. It's surprisingly watchable.

G: My favorite part of that is the extras where Erik Spiekermann, famous german font designer, rails against Arial. No, actually he's ranting about Microsoft. Everyone has a reason why they hate Microsoft. You know for Linux developers it's because they put Linux on their hit list and for Eric Spiekermann, font designer, it's because they made a bastardized  version of Helvetica and that's what Arial is. They didn't want to pay the licensing fees so they thought, well it's cheaper for us to just make our own from scratch that looks mostly like it rather than paying licensing fees. So that's why he hates Microsoft. I thought that was kind of funny.

S: Wow, I did not know that! Is that why the literati, the fontanistas don't like Arial?

R: Apparently. I had no idea. The funny thing is if you watch that font conference clip, Arial Narrow is the backwoods lumber jack redneck hick. [Laughs] It's really funny.

S: You know, I just, how do you know when two fonts aren't the same font? I mean I'm looking at some fonts right now and Walbaum and Bodoni look like the same font. Palatino and Lexicon looks the same. I mean I'm not sure.

R: You're going to get an e-mail about that.

S: No, I'm being totally straight with you. I'm looking here at a list of fonts and I'm thinking to myself, "Ok, Sabon, Minion, Joanna, Palatino, Lexicon all look like Times New Roman to me." Right? And at this point some poor font guy's brain just exploded and he's like screaming in pain. It's like, ok, so I've got a knock off Louis Vuitton bag. Is Louis Vuitton really… imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? Did they steal Helvetica? I mean, is there a simpler font on the planet than Helvetica?

G: You got to be a special kind of person, specific kind of person to do that because it's funny. You look at, I think it was Mark Simonson or something has designed some beautiful typefaces and he posted some of his handwriting and it was *horrible*. And you ask some of these type designers to design a web page or something, they couldn't do it. It's this very specific skill. When I was at this conference a couple years ago  they had a critique session where, and I believe it was the guy who did Georgia was one of the guys commenting, and people would  bring in stuff that they had been working on for *years* and they would look and it and go, "Yea, you know it needs a little more spacing here, or this is to big or small", or something like that. I mean it's just a huge amount of work to get something to look right.

[Musical interlude]

R: Many thanks to Geoffrey Grosenbach once again for sharing his thoughts on style and design. If you're interested, check out his blog at http://blog.peepcode.com.

[Musical interlude]

#### Act 2

S: Jeff Atwood told me once that you're not a real programmer until you build your own computer from scratch and parts. So I did that. Damien Guard told me I'm not a real programmer until I write my own programmer font from scratch.

R: Really?

S: That's insane.

R: That's… yeah.

S: He has spent thousands and thousands of hours creating his own programmer font. The thing is, the more hours he spends, the more insane it sounds and the more I respect him for doing it. I mean if you're going to stare at this thing for literally thousands of hours a year, why shouldn't you make your own?

R: My wife knits, does your wife knit, Scott?

S: My wife… [laughs], *believes* that she can knit.

R: It's funny, knitting is one of those things that you'll be talking to somebody about anything and they'll just reach over,  grab a bag, out come the knitting needles and they just start knitting while you're talking. It's just one of those passively strange things but they're fully capable of keeping a conversation going.

So I'm at Brad Wilson's house and Damien is there and he whips out his Macintosh. We're all talking, he whips out his Macintosh, and he starts coding his font.

S: **Coding** his font.

R: Coding his font.

S: That's the word. It's not designing, it's not drawing, it's not paint brush. He codes it.

R: Yeah, and he was able to talk to us at the same time as like, making hint rules. And I asked him, "What the heck are you doing?" And so he proceeded to show me all about it. It was absolutely fascinating.

S: It is. It's an entire universe. A font is an executable piece of code as much as anything.

There are few people who know more about fonts than Bill Hill. I mean this is the guy who was involved in designing ClearType. This man loves his fonts. He drinks them, he eats them, he sleeps with them. But it's ultimately not about the fonts for Bill. It's about the reading. This is a man who loves books. He loves absorbing information and a bad font slows him down.

Now Damien didn't find a programmer font, so he wrote his own. Bill Hill didn't like the way reading felt on the screen so he revolutionized the industry.

R: What's even crazier about Bill, is that I've known Bill for years but I didn't know he was Bill Hill. I knew him as the grizzled old Scotsman that would go surfing out in the bay, out in Hanalei Bay. We'd talk every now and again and I just thought, "Wow, this is a muscly old grizzled Scotsman, what a cool guy." And then I find out it's Bill Hill, the inventor of ClearType. So, I grab my microphone one day, you and I decided to do a show on fonts, and this is what we got.

[Break]

Bill Hill: We invented ClearType. It was myself, Bert Keely, Greg Hitchcock, and Mike Duggan at Microsoft. It was the four of us who invented and implemented ClearType. And the reason we did it at the time was, Bert and I were working on e-books. Which is another whole story because just last week Microsoft announced they're killing off the reader which we built. Which had actually given them a ten year technology lead which they then proceeded to squander. We can talk about that a bit more later on.

Screen resolutions at that time were about eighty-eight pixels per inch. The best of them were maybe ninety-six. And it's not good enough to show text. It works fine to display type headings and stuff like that but not for the text that we actually read.

We read using a part of the retina called the Fovea. It's only point-two of a millimeter across. And it has one and a half degrees of visual arc. What that means is, we need to read type, not *want to* but *need* to read type between nine and thirteen points in size. Point being a seventy-second of an inch. So, twelve point type is a sixth of an inch high. We need to read type at those sizes at normal reading distances. It's not a question of want, it's about the human physiology.

So you can't just make the type bigger in e-books and things like that. It doesn't really work. There's not enough pixels to show the subtlety of type.

The way that the human visual system interacts with type and the way that the brain interacts with type is very, very interesting. I mean, it's the result of five and half thousand years of evolution since we first invented writing systems.

The type that you look at today in a magazine or on your iPad, is the result of five hundred and fifty years of Darwinian evolution since Gutenberg. But what survived and what didn't died. And that's why, you know if you look at a book - open any paperback book - they look pretty much the same right? They have about the same width of margins, about the same width of a column of text. About the same size type. Because all humans are the same, right? We're all africans, we all left Africa a hundred and forty thousand years ago, or there a bouts. Every human being on the face of the planet has the same DNA markers as a guy who left Africa at that time. So we're all the same. It doesn't matter whether you're Japanese or Chinese, you read type roughly the same sizes because we all have the same size Fovea.

Anyway, not enough pixels to show the subtlety of type. Which actually helps the human eye to recognize, the human brain to recognize word shapes and so on. So we had to figure out a way. I mean the hardware wasn't going to get any better for awhile.

Bert Keely was one of the guys who knew more about LCD displays than anybody else I know. Bert and I started talking and the very first time we got together you could feel the sparks in the room. We pretty much invented ClearType in the first two hours of talking together. It took us about a week to kind of refine the idea.

We went to Greg Hitchcock, because Greg had worked for me and Greg knew all about the TrueType rasterizer in Windows and how it worked and so on. Greg got Mike Duggan involved and Mike did some pixel poppin' prototypes. Going in and changing the RGB values and the sub pixel. Greg phoned Bert and I, and said, "You guys have got to come over and look at this." We were expecting it to be an improvement, we did **not** expect it to be nearly as good as it was. It was like, whoa!

The inspiration was that people had been dealing with a pixel as a single unit. A square black or white pixel. But inside that pixel on a liquid crystal display screen there are actually three sub pixels. There's red, a green, and a blue. That's how you get the colors. Well, if you deal with the red, green, and blue as separate pixels you actually have three times as much resolution in the horizontal dimension.

Now, you get all kinds of color fringing problems if you start to deal with that, but if you filter the signal you can take the color fringing down to a point where it's not perceptible by humans. Still there, but below human perception. So it's actually taking how the human being sees color and using that to minimize the effect of treating each of these pixels as if they're either black or white. And that gives us three times as much resolution. In one dimension, but it so happens that's the *hard* one. The horizontal dimension, especially in western type is the tough one. So, we found this magic switch where we just turned it and suddenly you had all of this additional resolution. I mean the first time we saw a passage of text laid out like that, it was like whoa, holy shit.

[Musical interlude]

B: I think within that first week we'd filed five patents. And we showed it to Bill Gates and Bill said, "That's amazing." He said, "I can't see the color at all. How did you guys do that?" And his second question was, "I hope you guys have patented this!" And that's what we did.

I mean it was kind of weird, because like two months before that  I'd gotten chewed up by the shark infested waters of Windows and I'd been on a six week job search and I was six hours from leaving the company.

R: Wow!

B: I mean, I finally got offered a job. I had six hours left to run on the clock. Two months later, I'm on a stage with Bill Gates at COMDEX, his major speech of the year. We're announcing ClearType. And I'm like, some kind of hero. It's the weirdest life sometimes.

S: The giant thirty inch monitor that I'm looking at is still ninety-six dots per inch. And that's just not enough dots to make a font look good. And I can't make anymore dots. Unless I go and get a higher resolution display. So I look at a ninety-six dot per inch screen and I look down at my six *hundred* dot per inch laser printer paper, and I look back up at my ninety-six dot per inch screen. But what Bill and his friends figured out is that there are three pixels to make one pixel. Red, green, blue. Which are called sub pixels. It's actually *not* ninety-six dots per inch. It's many times that.

So by taking control of those sub pixels and an awareness of the order in which they are, sometimes they're RGB and on some monitors they're BGR; they invented ClearType. And the gravity of this cannot be underestimated. They increased the resolution of my screen and how text felt without me buying new hardware. It literally breathed new life into reading on my monitor.

[Musical interlude]

R: ClearType was an amazing invention, but it turns out not everyone was ecstatic about it. Corporate culture is really weird sometimes. 

B: ClearType was introduced in XP but the Windows guys buried it so deep nobody could ever find it. It was there but you had to get like five dialogs deep into the Display Properties dialog to actually find out how to turn it on. It was really tough to try and innovate at Microsoft. To do something that changes Windows in such a fundamental way.

[Musical interlude]

B: It just kind of panicked people. I know of at least one manager who boasted of how she had managed to prevent ClearType from being turned on by default in XP. I mean part of the opposition was, it didn't make the people who'd fired me look very good. [Laughs] That was definitely one thing about it. The other thing was that it did mean they had to do some fundamental things. Bill [Gates] was pounding on them. The minute he saw ClearType he said, "I want this in Windows."

[Musical interlude]

B: In Apple when Steve Jobs said something you did it or you got fired. At Microsoft, because they were so dependent on the huge revenue streams from Windows and Office, the Windows and Office teams knew how to play Bill [Gates]. The trump card was always, "Well, you know, we can do this but it'll delay shipping of Windows by three months." Or, six months or something. That was the card that always got played when you were introducing something that wasn't in the original plan. That's the thing at Microsoft and it got even more so with Steven Sinofsky in place, where there's a plan and they execute to the plan. That's all very well, it works great, except that maybe it takes you two years to build a version of Windows and you start planning it and things change. Sometimes you just get a wild card, like ClearType that appears out of nowhere. What you *should* be able to do in a situation like that is grab it and go with it. Where as it was like, "How do we deal with this? This is going to cause us all kinds of problems. Let's bury it fives layers deep in the dialog so nobody can get to it."

So it turned out Apple actually implemented ClearType. They implemented their own version but the major cross-licensing deal between Microsoft and Apple meant that Apple got all of the patents for ClearType so they could implement their own version. So you remember that patent cross-licensing deal? I think it was 1997, Bill Gates did it with Steve Jobs at a time when Apple was just about to go under. Microsoft put up a hundred and fifty million bucks and there was a patent cross-licensing and that lasted through the period of the ClearType patents. The ClearType patents were all in 1998 and 1999, the base ones. So they were all part of that. So Apple got the rights to it. They've never actually acknowledged that they're using the same thing, Apple wouldn't do that. Microsoft wouldn't do it if they'd gotten a piece of Apple technology. They just don't do that kind of thing. But, in effect it was their implementation of ClearType.

[Musical interlude]

B: It's our take, and if you talk to someone like Greg Hitchcock, the Apple guys didn't do as good a job as we did. We did a lot better job because we used the hinting mechanism in TrueType to do some stuff as well. Like snapping outline edges to high contrast pixel boundaries and stuff like that. So Microsoft has twenty-five maybe thirty ClearType patents. We've really parted on the technology. We really did a lot of development, a lot of innovation around it. However, having said that, fast forward ten years, twelve years. You have devices like the iPad, a hundred and thirty-three PPI. My Macbook Pro has a hundred and thirty-three PPI. Now Dell introduced a hundred and thirty-three PPI in 1996 or 1997. They introduced a hundred and forty-seven the following year but never got anywhere because they were all running Windows, the Windows UI did not scale.

I was running a two-hundred and four dots per inch, twenty-two inch IBM monitor on XP in 1998. Two-hundred and four dots per inch. Twenty-five forty by nineteen hundred and whatever. Huge resolution I was running at but I had to jump through all kinds of hoops to make it happen.

Talking about how ClearType got kind of buried in XP, the crazy thing about it was it wasn't turned on by default until Vista shipped. Which was ten yeas after we had invented it. Ten years before customers were getting it on automatically because Vista took so long. You know they had that whole false start and took about five years to build Vista.

R: So, I could pretty much stop the interview right there and I'd be pretty happy. Bill Hill, as you can tell, is a really amazing speaker, incredibly intelligent man. The story of ClearType is pretty dramatic but the story continues. Some of the fonts that you use every single day. Cambria, Consolas, Calibri, Georgia, Verdana, all of those TrueType fonts - well guess who was in charge of the group that created those fonts. That's right, Bill.

#### TODO: 35:36, not sure of correct spelling for Eleazer ??Coons?? in following section.

B: The fonts people at Microsoft have been years ahead. A typical example, the very first project I approved when I went to Microsoft to run the typography group. The very first project I signed off on was to get this somewhat well known font designer called Matthew Carter to design two new typefaces specifically for reading lots of text on the web. Verdana and Georgia. That was the first project I did.

When I arrived at Microsoft, it was to work for a guy called Steve Shaman who *got* type. They'd been looking for someone to run the typography group for quite some time. The typography group was a bit that was left over after one section of the team had gone into Word. Eleazer **??Coons'??** team that were doing line services, the composition engine for Word. The group that was left behind had no real clear vision of the future. It was still very much thinking about the whole printing thing. And what I did when I took over the team was, first of all I had my own epiphany which was, "You know what, the screen is the future. We need to focus on that." Then I took the team for an off-site. We did two days of brainstorming and planning, came back, produced a report. A strategic plan called, Read It Anywhere. It basically said fonts are strategic to Microsoft because text is the major data type for all of our users. The web's going to be huge. (This was before Microsoft decided the web's going to be huge.) We said the web's going to be huge, we need to get a web life. Get our own web site, get stuff running up there. Figure out what the problems are and what our customers are going to need. Start building fonts for them. So Verdana and Georgia were examples of that. Go build a couple of fonts that were specifically designed, because most type has been designed for print.

So when you design type you design these high resolution outlines you use for print and then you've got to figure out what it looks like on a screen, when the rasterizer turns it into dots. But you know what? There ain't many dots to play with so you end up having to fudge all this stuff and it looks horrible, a lot of the time. What we did with Verdana and Georgia was design type completely differently. We *started* with the bitmap, the screen bitmaps that we wanted to see at ten and twelve point, the important reading sizes. And then designed the outlines so that the rasterizer would generate exactly those bitmaps. And then we can work from that. Instead of starting with the high resolution outlines and ending up with the bitmaps, we started with the bitmaps and eventually created the high resolution outlines. Completely back to front. But that's why when Verdana and Georgia appeared they were the most readable typefaces that anybody could find out there on the web and they went everywhere. Not so much Georgia but Verdana, Verdana is everywhere. It has been for the decade or more since we did it.

[Musical interlude]

B: Serif fonts are more readable for longer periods of text. The serifs kind of give you a very stable baseline because they delineate the baseline. The end of a serif can lead your eye along to the next letter. They also help to create word shapes that we recognize very well. It's less stressful for us to read long passages of text with a serif font than a sans-serif font. It's the human eyes, the way it works. So here I am I've got six hours left to run on my job search, actually no it was a week or two before that. I started talking to Dick Brass who was the vice president of Microsoft's electronic book group. May 1998 thereabouts.

Now Dick was vice president of three people including himself at that time. Had no technical people. No technology, no credibility, nothing. No track record at Microsoft. During my interview process I said to Dick, "Dick, I don't care how small an electronic book is, how light it is, how long the battery runs for, how many books it can hold, how cheap those books are. The rubber meets the road when somebody picks up an electronic book device and tries to have the same experience they have with a printed book."

Now think about the experience you have with a printed book. You  pick it up, the printed book just disappears, right? The actual physical object just disappears and you're in the world of the author. How the hell does it do that? What's going on? I said, "If we can solve that problem, figure it out and do the same thing for electronic books, then electronic books are the future. If we can't, we might as well pack up and go home right now." So Dick said to me, "Your job will be readability researcher, go figure out how we do it."

B: And that was the start of this really intensive project. During the next couple of months, I read, I counted them up, about twelve thousand pages of books, magazines, journals, etc. Plus everything I knew before. I jammed all this data into my head.

Now, what's interesting is there are two parts of my life that have always seemed completely separate to one another. There's this whole technology piece and the writing, stuff like that, and there's nature.

When I came to the States, I got involved in animal tracking and wilderness skills, and I started to spend a lot of time in the woods, tracking. Now, how did humans first learn to read? It was actually before we invented writing. What we used to read were the stories in the tracks.

[Musical interlude]

B: I'm in the woods, I'm tracking a coyote, I'm reading a story.  I can see this guy's going along just at kind of a regular pace. He's not in a hurry, he's not moving slower; which tells me he's not afraid of something or chasing something which would make him faster. He's not lying back or stalking something, which would make him slower. He's just kind of boppin' along and he turned his head here and I wonder what he was looking at. All this stuff you can tell from the tracks. I'm doing this in the woods and suddenly a light bulb goes off in my head and I realize what the technology of reading and writing is all about. That's how text has evolved to allow the information to stream in straight into our brain without us even having to think about it.

[Musical interlude]

R: Bill looks exactly the way he sounds. He's got his long grey hair pulled back into a pony tail, big old scraggly beard, piercing blue eyes as he stares into you. They dance around as he explains the passion of his life's work. When we did the interview it was a really, really hot day out and it's pretty common to see people around here walk around without a shirt on and that's exactly what Bill was doing. I remember thinking to myself, "You look exactly like a Scottish highlander. I only hope that I look as good as you when I get your age. And not only that, I hope I'm as excited about my work."

B: A book's like a three hundred page long waterside for attention. You get on and you just keep sliding through it. And all of the technology, font shapes, font size, spacing, word spacing, line length, margins, page size, all that stuff is set up because what we use when we read is a high resolution scanning machine. It's got six hundred dots per inch resolution. It scans four targets a second, and moves between targets. It takes it twenty-five milliseconds to move between targets. So it scans four targets a second. It's a high precision, high speed scanning machine. And what happens is, that gets into a rhythm. And the whole technology of text, the margins are cues for where you start recognizing and where you end recognizing. The line end, and the distance between lines, is the optimal one that allows you to jump back to the beginning of the next line. In fact, that's a later development.

When people first started writing, in one of the ancient greek forms of writing called Boustrophedon which is the word for "as an ox plows the field". So you started and you went left to right, and then right to left, and then left to right. So it was an unbroken track of meaning. But the problem is, once you invent an alphabet words have a directionality. They're either left to right, or right to left. So we had to avoid writing them backwards on the second line. What we did instead is invent a convention that says when you get to the end of one line, jump to the beginning of the next one. And you set the distance between the two so that the eye kind of naturally falls into that. So it's all about creating this rhythm.

When an animal runs, when an animal's walking around, that coyote was just in his natural gate - what trackers call harmonic gate. When a long legged animal like a coyote, or a cougar, or a wolf, or a deer is walking, the imprint of the rear foot is right on top of the imprint of the front foot. Because their legs are the same length. If the animal's going faster than normal the rear feet tend to start coming out in front. Because it's getting into this kind of galloping phase. And if it's going slower they tend to be a bit further back because it's not taking quite such long steps. That's the harmonic gate of an animal.

We have a harmonic gate when we read. It's our own natural gate. It's a complex thing because it involves the way the type is set and the distance we are from the light and also our own level of understanding of the content. Because you know if we come across a work that we don't…, and our own eye-sight, you know it gets worse. So, we all have a harmonic gate and the technology of type has developed to allow, to enable, us to create this level playing field over which everyone who reads can run at their own pace.

I went back to the house, I wrote this paper. I think I wrote it pretty much nonstop. Eighty pages. It explained how the human visual system was used in order to read. How print worked. Why the screen didn't work back then. What we had to do to fix it, and I kind of defined, here's all the things that we need to do. I called the paper, The Magic Of Reading. It's up, you can find it on the web. Bill Gates read that paper five times. He told my boss, he read it five times. That set the whole user interface for Microsoft Reader, the e-book software. ClearType kind of helped grow that as well, all that effort. The crazy thing about Microsoft Reader is they announced last week or the week before they're going to kill it. But if you took Microsoft Reader today and put it on an iPad, it would be every bit as good as iBooks or the Kindle Reader. It's every bit as good. And we did it twelve years ago. We gave them a twelve year technology lead.

You know, I recently read a paper by a group at Stanford on why startups fail. And ninety percent of the reasons are premature scaling. And you don't think that'd be a problem at a place like Microsoft, but it is. Because the e-book team is basically a small technology startup. And it got scaled too far, too fast.

The team had always said, in order to succeed in e-books we need a device and we need a store, a bookstore. Microsoft didn't want a part of either of those. We actually built a really nice prototype way back then. It had a hundred and fifty dots per inch screen, better display than this, [tapping].  We built one, but it was too expensive given the technology. And we couldn't get the battery to run for long enough. To put it into the hands of a customer would probably cost twelve hundred bucks. Too much. I mean, nowadays that would probably be about three hundred, four hundred bucks. And that's acceptable, but back then it wasn't and we couldn't get the battery to run for longer than a couple hours. Although, that said, we'd never actually done a lot of the optimization because we'd never gotten to productize it.

So we built a prototype. We wanted to have a bookstore but Microsoft didn't want to get into a competition with Amazon on a bookstore. So who are the two companies that succeed in electronic books? Amazon and Apple, right? And what do they both have? A device, and a bookstore. [Laughs]

As I said, we had the software, we had the team, but I'd been so badly burned that all I wanted to do was be an individual contributor. I didn't want to manage anybody at Microsoft ever again. It was horrible. I mean, I often tell people, I spent fourteen and a half years at Microsoft. Three of those years were the best working years of my life and eleven of them were the worst. The absolute worst.

[Musical interlude]

B: What happened was that once the e-books thing got canned. I actually looked around at the survivors and said, we've got to try and figure out a way to keep these people alive. So I stepped up and started to manage them. But there was no way that you were actually getting a free hand to do what was needed to be done. It was kind of a wounded animal by that time.

Eventually I ended up in Internet Explorer. Naively, I was told, "Hey, come help us make reading great on the screen." So I arrived, but you know what? That team was so focused on feature parity with Firefox that nobody was listening. So I was there for a couple of years, basically I was just spinning my wheels.

[Musical interlude]

B: When I started in type I actually worked for a newspaper that still set its type in hot metal. I can still read type upside down, back to front, from six feet away and edit it in my head. [Laughs]

So I've watched the technology go through this incredible progression. I started back in newspapers in Scotland in 1968. And I did everything, you know. I wrote, I edited, I proofread. I went down to the case room. Did the stone subbing, sized pictures, did the page make up. Soup to nuts, the whole thing. I was like nineteen years old. It was an incredible opportunity. I went through about eighteen years of working in newspapers so I'm very familiar with that whole delivery of information thing. And then I got involved in desktop publishing in 1984, about three years before the market took off. I'm a newspaper guy. If a paragraph is longer than thirty words it's too long. That's how I write also.

When I left newspapers to join the software industry I thought,  "Well that's it, there goes my writing skills. I won't need those ever again." Wrong, wrong. Because the ability to write meant that I could write a report and Bill Gates would read it five times. Because it was a good read, that was a good story.

R: Good story indeed, thanks Bill. That was a privilege. If you want to read more about what Bill is up to, have a look at his blog. It's up at http://billhillsblog.blogspot.com.

S: Well I don't know about you Rob but I just thank the good Lord that somebody cared. Somebody cared about fonts and that we're not all running MS Sans Serif non anti-aliased right now on all our machines.

R: And what a weird thing. I surf with this guy, I've known this guy. He lives in my backyard. And here he is.

S: It was funny because we're sitting around saying, "We should do a show on fonts."

R: Yeah…

S: Oh, and I said, "You know who we should get? Bill Hill." and you said, "Bill Hill? The Scottish guy with the beard?", "Yeah, he's like super famous." "Really?" And then you said, "Oh, uh, let me e-mail him. He'll probably not answer."

R: [Laughing]

S: Literally, I was still on the phone with you and he says, "Name the time."

R: Yeah exactly! And I remember I said, "I gotta go man. He's gonna meet me across the street." In case people are listening to the audio and wondering why it's kind of gorilla; I grab my mobile unit, I run over there, there're clanging dishes and whatever and I just stuck it in front of his face and I could barely hold the microphone straight. What an amazing guy.

[Musical interlude]

R: So are we caring about fonts now? I mean, last time we decided to care about style and now are we telling people they have to care about fonts?

S: I think it just means that we're fancy.

R: I like that. We can leave it right there.
