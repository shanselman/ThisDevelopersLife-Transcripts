Competition
=========

Scott: I play Angry Birds. And I've had my Angry Birds obsession. But, seriously, three stars on every level... I mean I like marching through the 185000 Angry Birds levels as much as the next guy, but I don't know my score. I like X-Box, but I don't know my achievements, I like StackOverflow, but I don't know my points. I know how tall I am and how fat I am. But that's as far as I go. Numbers like that... score is not my thing. I'm not competitive... like that!

Jon Skeet: (couldn't get this at 1:36) I keep an eye on the numbers. The current number that I'm keeping my eye on is my number of silver badges. I think I'm at 954 or something mm.. that's a thing, so obviously I'm trying to get that to a 1000, so in 47 more badges time I will expand the number of digits in my flare. And that's all slightly exiting.

Rob: I like to surf. And it's a wonderful zen-like sport, sit in the water, catch some waves. And I hear while I live in the Hawaii they have the best waves in the world. And there's a spot right down the street from me, that is one of the best waves in the entire world. Will I serf there? Nooot very often. Not much of low high in this light hub.

Aaron Jensen: Whenever I get into something I get very intense about it, and do it all the time, and almost to .. well definitely to attaching up with poker. I definitely played a lot. I don't necessarily like the person I become when I play too much poker.
