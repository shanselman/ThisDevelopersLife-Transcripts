### Taste

Scott: Appearance matters. It matters in America. It matters anywhere in the world. We all like to think that the internet is the great equalizer, that this is Ameritocracy; if you do well and you write great code you'll rise to the top. 

What if that's not the case? What if good taste matters just as much? What if a nice suit and a good pair of shoes are just as important as being a decent coder or a great designer?

Taste. Do you have taste? Do you want good taste? Can you develop it, or are you born with it? Style and taste - this week on 'This Developer's Life'.

[musical interlude]

Rob: I'm definitely with you on that, especially when it comes to clothes and how you look. I think for developers, people just don't pay attention to their appearance very much and..

S: [laughs]

Really? Really? I'm hearing this from Jimmy Buffet here. Nice shirt, Rob. You're in Hawaii with a Puka shell necklace and you're telling me about style?

R: Well, you know, I tell you, context, my friend. Over here, these aloha shirts, a lot of them cost a lot of money. Not this one that I'm wearing, but this is considered a nicer shirt over here. You can get a really nice aloha shirt from a designer like Tori Richard. Those things cost A LOT of money. Over here you see guys wearing them around; you can tell that person has taste. 

S: Special Hawaiian taste.

R: Exactly. It's all context. 

S: well there are no aloha shirts here, but I can tell you this. You really can't overdress. My wife always tells me that it's always better to show up one notch better dressed, than show up one notch underdressed. 

One time I landed in Washington D.C. and I got a text that we were going to go to the White House. They said, you need to be ready at 4 o'clock and the dress is business formal. So I had to go and google what business formal was. I'm pretty sure I know what business casual is but I'm not 100% sure of business formal. I realized, it means a suit; a full on suit with tie and  the whole thing, and the cufflinks. I had nothing. I had landed in acid-washed jeans.

R: [laughing] Acid-washed…OHHH!!

S: I don't think the president wants to see my acid-washed jeans. So I ran out and I hailed a cab and I said, "Find me the nearest 'Men's Warehouse'". I burst into the 'Men's Warehouse' and I said, "I need a suit in the next 30 minutes". I put together a complete suit in 30 minutes and I left the cab driver outside with the meter running. 

R: Was it an acid-washed suit?

S: It was not an acid-washed suit. 

I ran in there and, just like Iron Man with a suitcase, they assembled a complete outfit for me. I walked out. I wore the suit out. I went straight to the White House. I showed up on time. Just behind me come some of the other folks; one of them wearing white linen pants, a vest, and flip flops. So I asked the organizer, "Why did you text us and tell us to come business formal?". 

She said, "Well I had really low expectations, so I told everyone business formal so they would come as dressed up as they could be".

I still have that suit. The suit that I wore one time to go to the White House. I'm ready the next time that I have to go. 

R: I have to say, I'm impressed. The White House, that's an impressive thing.

S: Well it was actually the Eisenhower building next door. But I checked-in on Foursquare at the White house. 

R: Okay, that's a big check-in.

Okay, so looks matter. That's what we're saying. Aesthetics matter. Looks matter. Tastes matter. 

S: I wouldn't say looks matter, but having a sense of style, a sense of the aesthetic, a sense of smell…matters. I realize that it doesn't make sense to everyone. Why should I wear pants? Why does it matter? 

Well there isn't always logic behind it, but there is a sense of feeling. You know that feeling - when you wore your suit at a funeral or a wedding. That formality and the way it changes how you feel. That is what I think taste and design and aesthetic is about, that changes how you feel. 

R: But we're just a bunch of geeks. I mean, we don't know. 

S: Well we don't. So we find someone who does. So I went and found Michael Bach who's a designer at Microsoft. They actually do have designers at Microsoft.

R: That's surprising.

S: It's true. 

He is slowly turning the big ship around. One well-thought-out design at a time. 

[musical interlude]

Michael: Designers here are known as people who just make things pretty. You know what I mean? 

Our small design group, which is like 2 of us, we feel like we do a lot more than just make things pretty. Right? We add the emotional feel to a product. The non-tangible stuff that you can't really put your finger on. 

The way it works with developers is, we have to break it down in a logical way for them to understand what we're trying to do before they even bat an eye at giving anything a chance to making it to a product. 

If we say something and there's absolutely no logical reason behind it, there's no way it's going to get shipped in the product because they're the one who's implementing it. They won't implement anything they can't understand. I think that's the hardest part about working with such a huge developer organization - the not understanding aspect. Trying to get some stuff done when there's a million other tangible features that can get built. 

S: Yeah, I read this article about Google. A guy who left Google. He said that he knew he was going to leave when he was in an argument in a meeting with a lot of engineers about whether he should have a 3 pixel wide border, or 5 pixel wide border. 

M: Yeah. 

S: They wanted to run polls and do data analysis on that. 

M: Exactly. I can bring back a similar story to that. When we were shipping Web Matrix (v1 I think).

Web matrix just has this soft, not too harsh feel that we were going for. One of the things that we really wanted to change was the colors that we were using in the code surface. If you look at Visual Studio, you can see they use a bright blue, super rich red, and deep orange for some of their HTML and CSS. Highlighting effects.

With Web Matrix we thought that looked way too harsh on the code surface. So the team spent 3 days iterating on photoshop - changing the opacity of the blues and changing the opacity of the red. All the developers seriously thought we were crazy.They were saying, "There's no way you can do it this way, we need the bright red, we need the bright blue because of the contrast. We want to see our code in bright colors".

We spent the 3 days and wrote the XML file that they needed to change the color of the code. A week later everyone came back and was like, "For some reason Web Matrix feels soft. It doesn't feel jarring and the code surface feels like it blends in right with the app". They couldn't figure out what we did. All we really did was take the saturations of all the colors and desaturated them by 15%. Some small, insignificant number like that. Those little changes that were fought through instead of slipping them through the typical bug cycle that Microsoft does.  We just have to back-channel all these types of changes.

The funny thing is, people do notice even though they didn't notice that it was even done. I think that's similar to that one   pixel story. They were looking for a logical reason to get this one pixel thing and the designer just said, "this lighter blue looks way better". There's no possible way for him to logically argue why that light blue was better. The same reason why no one could really argue why the lighter blue in the code surface was way better. 

S: Sometimes when developers hear you guys, I'll refer to you as 'you guys', talking about stuff, talk about it in very emotional terms. Like feeling and depth and texture, almost like you're describing food. 

M: Yeah.

S: When you talk about design. Engineers talk about crisp, sharp, clear, clarity…it doesn't compile, type things. 

Who is more right? Is one of us more or less human?

[musical interlude]

M: No, I don't think so actually. I think it's just a different way of thinking. I feel like developers have such a zero-to-one type mentality. Where the feature that you're designing, the task they're doing, it either works or it doesn't work. If it works it's a success, if it doesn't, then it doesn't. Right?

Well for us, we think of it more in the way of, well, it works but there's a whole bunch of different aspects about how it works. Like, did it feel good? Did it look good? 

If you're talking about food - if you're a developer you're eating food just to fill your body up. Right? If you're a designer you're taking in the smell. You're taking in the texture. You're  taking in how fast it takes you to digest. How smooth the fruit might be, or how rough it might be. All those things add up to the entire eating experience. I think that exists for everything we do whether it's writing code or it's typing IM on an IM client, or anything like that. It's a difference in how the two parties approach life. Programming is such a problem solving practice. Your metric is, does it work or does it not work? Our metrics are, does it feel good? That's just a good contrast of how non-tangible the work we do is. 

There's a poetry in the way you guys write code; in the way it's organized and the way it's thought. There's a rhythm and poetry in the way our visual designs are laid out. The perfect spacing, the really sharp, crisp lines, the rendering of every single element, the color consistency. All those things are tangible things you can actually measure. 

That's what we notice a lot when we notice the difference between a regular designer and someone who's just out of school, for example. Someone who's just learned photoshop. They might lay a bunch of tiles or images. If you look at it from a designer point of view, you can see that - you notice that the one image is two pixels off. You know that's wrong, but from an untrained eye, which I see a lot from a junior designer to a developer, hey don't notice those one or two pixels that are off. The people on my team, and me, we can tell the difference between one pixel and two pixels. Thats how trained our eye has become. 

S: People always joke about stereotypes around people with certain style. If you're a designer or person with style you have nice shoes, you have a nice house, you're organized. People who don't have style are developers who have funny clothes and they're not very social. 

M: Yeah.

S: Are those things true and how do they relate?

M: I think they're true because design doesn't just stop at the work you're doing. If you're a designer, you notice everything  that's around you. You look at architecture, you look at fashion, you look at designs for different inspiration. I think as a designer, it's just because you care about those things, you kind of spread it out into your whole life. You look at a lot of designers, they love their Macs because all the colors match, their desks, everything matches. 

I think as a designer it goes back to that thought that we're talking about. That binary aspect. Do I have clothes? Yes. Does it cover me up? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Bug solved. There's a million little things that makes Windows 7 work better than Windows XP. If you're going to ask a developer, they'll tell you one works better than the other. 

A good example is: There's this one time where we made a minor change to a dialog box. To us it felt like a major change. We actually changed the grid, we changed the spacing between the menu items, we changed the spacing between the buttons, and we made the buttons a little bit lighter. We showed A and B to one developer. One developer was asked "What's the difference between A and B?". 

They were like "It's exactly the same". Clearly it's not exactly the same. They were color differences. The same elements were on the screen but they were clearly, visually different. Their answer was, "it looks the same". 

We said, "Hey, look closer". We started to point out all the things that were different. 

At that point they zoomed in their focus and were like, "Oh, yea you're right. That spacing, the menu spacing IS a tiny bit taller". 

So we asked, "Why do you feel that menu looks better?".

They started looking at it and they were like, "Because it feels like there's more space".

Bingo. But they didn't notice any of that stuff until we actually narrowed it down for them. 

S: But if they didn't notice it, why does it matter?

M: It's the reason why someone picks one car over the other, one shirt over the other shirt, or looks at a picture and thinks one picture is better than another picture. 

All the things you learn in school: visual hierarchy, harmony, all those things; I think normal people can feel those things they just can't pinpoint it just like the developers can't, but on a lower level. I think that's why it matters to a lot of people. 

If it works but it feels tight or cluttered, or feels boxy, or it feels round, those feelings are triggered. It might not be triggered where you say, "I completely notice that aspect". But there are these triggers that go on in your head and kind of tell you whether what you're looking at is right or wrong. 

S: Sometimes I feel like we, developers, are supposed to care about design because designers tell us we should. They say it really loud. 

I look at applications that are utilities that have been around forever. Like Infraviewer and Filezilla, these are ugly. Ugly applications. Horrendous. I only know that because I have used iPads and I know that when you value design, it's better, but I'm not sure if I really know that or you guys have just been telling me that so long that I now believe it. 

M: I'm not going to argue with the fact. I'm not going to say that how the product works. Design supplements functionality and functionality supplements design. It's this balance that we all try to aim for. 

Filezilla works super awesome. It does the job that it does. But can you not argue that if it was a nicer application and things were a little bit thought out in terms of design that…

Should we live in a world were good is just good enough? You know what I mean?

S: Sometimes I look back at pictures, haircuts, and facial hair that seemed like an awesome idea in the height of style 5 years ago and now it doesn't. 

My iPhone is starting to feel dated. 

M: Mhmm.

S: But it hasn't changed. It is static so that adds another variable.

M: Right.

Me, I feel like the whole feeling dated is more related to the fact that its ubiquitous. Right? You see it every day. You see exactly the way it looks. It hasn't changed and it gets boring. I think that's more in line with the fact that we get bored looking at things, and things need to change. 

In school we had this one test where the teacher showed us a radio. Same exact knobs, exact same UI. Then another radio that has the same buttons, same LCD screen, same text screens, and the exact same information. Nothing's changed but when we were doing a study of it, we went off to a bunch of consumers. We went to the mall and said, "Hey, which one seems easier for you to use?" 

It was 90%, almost unanimous, everyone said, "The one on the right". The only difference between the one on the right was visual treatments. It was the colors we used to design the user interface, the typeface we used to design the LCD readout that tells you what song is playing, the form factor was just slightly squished. The colors were overall just smoother. Those were the only difference between A and B of two radio designs, even though they were identically functional. Every button did the exact same thing. 

We think design is hand and hand, plays the same role that feature design does in making something feel great to use. You can have a big red button that looks really, really big. When you press it, it does the same thing, or you can have a really soft icon. The gradient soft iPhone-like icons that you see that make you really want to click it. Hey, they both take you to the same place, but the only thing different is the design. The right one feels like you want to click it. 

I remember a quote Steve Jobs said when I had a friend that worked at apple. What Steve Jobs wanted the UI to be was, he wanted it to be lickable. 

S: [snickers]

M: When you actually looked at the UI, you want to eat it like candy. Just for the very fact that when people see candy they want to grab it. It just sparks something in their primal senses. That's the birth of the aqua button that you see in Mac OS X. 

The way something looks and the way something feels changes the way something works. 

[musical interlude]

S: The food analogy really resonated with me because as a diabetic, a type I diabetic, I have some limitations on what I can eat. Sometimes I've been traveling and I've been over seas and someone will say, "Hey, you're in China. Why don't you have some real Chinese food?". I'll go to Subway sandwiches because it's what I know and what works with my blood sugar. 

The idea that good design and functionality can go hand in hand is really powerful but the food analogy, Michael hit a chord for me because I can either enjoy my food, or I can be really functional. I eat simple foods when I'm over seas so that I can perform and do my job. 

It got me thinking about design and functionality versus feeling and functionality. Can it look good and feel good at the same time? If it didn't, would I notice? 

[musical interlude]

I used to not care. I used to not care what I looked like. Then I started to realize it's such a small amount of effort for such a huge amount of a payback. You get so much more with a nice pair of shoes or jeans without a hole in them. 

I remember talking to a good friend of mine, Clint, at a conference. He's such a great guy, such a talented guy. I said to him, "Clint, you need to dress better". I gave him a whole lecture about the magic of leather shoes. Like if there's one thing a programmer can do to change their fashion experience, it's wear a pair of leather shoes. Stop wearing New Balance sneaks if you're trying to meet ladies or meet men. Put on a pair of leather shoes. 

He did that. He came back another year to a conference and he looked fantastic. I don't think he fully understands why, but I gave him a business rule and he applied the business rule. Hopefully that will allow him to pass even more tests than before. 

[musical interlude]

Design, fashion, style, taste - it's all the same. You can't separate the two. You can't come at me and show me a bunch of code with a giant switch statement. I don't care how many tests it passes. If you've got three nested switch statements, you're a bad person.

R: [laughing]

S: You're a slob. You need to stop. Right? When you see someone who's coming at me who's got flip flops and holey jeans and the, they call it a wifebeater, but its the v-neck t-shirts. You need to have a fashion intervention. I think the same thing applies to software and software design. Whether it be the design of the software, like the switch statement, or whether it be the low resolution icon. 

Make it stop.

####Act 2

R: Speaking of the marriage of function and design, it's interesting that Michael is talking about the interactions between developers and designers. I have a good friend, Geoffrey Grosenbach, who is a producer of the Ruby on Rails podcast. He's also Mr. PeepCode. He is probably the perfect marriage of an engineer and a designer in one body. We talked to him for this story this week. 

[musical interlude]

Geoffrey Grosenbach: Hello. Hey. You sound like you're right inside my head.

R: One of the things that Geoffrey's known for is the impeccable production quality of screencasts at PeepCode, as well as his blog blog.peepcode.com . If you go take a look at it, the visuals on it are amazing and often have a greater impact than the text that he actually writes.

I asked him about one post, in particular, that got a lot of attention where he challenged the Rails routing mechanism. The post led off with a massive graphic. It was pretty interesting. 

G: Oh yea, that was definitely a goal. A funny thing about that is that a lot of people look at that particular article which happens to have been posted the day before my daughter was born. which was...I guess she's 4 months old now.

I have 6 or 8 more drafts of articles which haven't seen the light of day yet, but that one is still up there. People who talk about that - it's the drawing by Mike Rohde, it's the quote by Reg Braithwaite. If they didn't scroll below the fold, they may not have even seen anything that I actually said or wrote. Just that header graphic. That was almost enough to carry it enough on its own.

I think that's one thing I've started to try to do with this, an article. Can it be read in multiple ways? If you read through a magazine you could just go through and just look at the pictures. People famously look at 'The New Yorker' by just reading all the cartoons, not even any of the articles. Maybe you just read all the poll quotes that are in big text from the article. Maybe you go and read the article itself. To go and create something where people can experience it on multiple levels and maybe even remember. So it's got something useful whether they looked at it for 5 seconds or 5 minutes. 

S: Geoffrey loves to provoke with his aesthetic sense. One of the posts he wrote had a bright orange background with a white image of a keyboard right in the header. Man it caused a lot of chatter. 

G: Oh yea, that was huge on Hacker News which, oddly, has orange in its logo, itself. I think that was kind of an accomplishment itself to get all of these geeks to have this extended discussion about aesthetics and shades of orange and color. How important that was and how wrong it was that it was done poorly. Oh, that's great, now people are thinking about these things and expressing opinions. You know, that's a win in my book. 

As a developer writing code, one has limited experiences to do front-end development like that. Now that I'm running my own business, I'm definitely doing a lot more of that. When I was working for companies or freelancing, I was never doing front-end kind of work but I enjoyed it and I wanted to get better at it. Well, you're not going to get better at something unless you're doing it. 

To me this was an opportunity to actually do this stuff. A lot of the techniques are fairly standard to what front-end designers are aware of and what they would do. Being able to take a design like that, be able to mull it over. Some of these posts I probably had it in draft for a month or even 6 weeks thinking about it. Tweaking things here and there. That's how I get to an end result. It doesn't just come all at once. It's doing this, tweaking this here, trying something a little here and there. 

S: Wow I checked out this guy's blog. Geoffrey's blog is amazing. It's gorgeous. It's not a blog, so much as a series of well designed, organized, full page magazine articles. It's absolutely amazing. 

R: Yeah. I mean, even the word 'stunning' would be appropriate here even though it sounds a little fanboyish I suppose. 

Geoff understands the power of aesthetics. Not only to convey a point, but also to revoke a response. Listen to what he did for the Rails conference that he went to a couple of years ago. 

G: I did wear a suit to maybe even a couple of the Rails conferences. Which, to me, is a nice kind of countercultural thing because everybody at tech conferences is in just t-shirts and jeans. So if you wear a suit you're bucking the trend. You're standing out from the crowd.

Part of the thing I like about an interesting outfit or a blog article, whatever, are all the different pieces that come into it and the stories of how all that happens. Maybe it's like the J. Peterman catalog (which I think I only read because it was mentioned on Seinfeld) where they would have these extensive descriptions of all the products they sell like:

  'These leather boots were harvested from cows in Tibet.'

At RailsConf, I wore my favorite Japanese sneakers. Bathing Ape sneakers with some kind of jeans and a suit coat. I think even a shirt I got in New York City. Part of it to me is the story, all the different pieces, how did they come together, and then hopefully, does it look interesting or noteworthy once it all comes together?

Sometimes it's a bunch of individual things that I think each think are interesting and hopefully then they all work together; or comfortable.I think in the last 4 months I got this really nice pair of fancy dress shoes. 

I think if you have a really old truck but you put nice chrome wheels on it - that thing looks hot. It can be the most run down, rusty truck but it has this one element of shiny, chrome wheels then suddenly it's a whole different thing and all you changed was one element of it. 

So for me, shoes are kind of that way. No matter what you're wearing, if you have interesting shoes that can kind of pick up the rest of the outfit; improves it and makes it look good. 

So I got these fancy dress shoes. I think I knew that I needed at least one pair of dress shoes, which I didn't really own. I was walking through a place and saw these and was like, "Oh, wow, those are amazing". Of course, they were pretty expensive. So, after a couple of months I thought, "Okay, I think I can buy these". I bought them and I wore them and the first day. One thing led to another and I had to walk a mile and a half in these shoes. These dress shoes, the very first time I wore them, and they were extremely comfortable. I had no blisters; they felt great. So now, that's the thing where these cool looking shoes, even if I wear them with jeans or something, I have this great looking outfit. These things that may not otherwise go together, but you put something together and suddenly it looks interesting. 

I do almost that exact thing; I get this uniform. The clothes I wear every day. I just buy several shirts of the exact same thing and several pants of the exact same thing and that's just what I wear around day to day because I know it works and I like the way it looks, and it fits, and that's my uniform.

The other thing, (I don't know where this relates but..) a friend called me out as a product snob a couple years ago. Which is basically, if I have an idea in mind or a certain product I want, I'm going to hold out until I find something that's functional; that looks aesthetically good. Often I will suffer with whatever substandard products I have or nothing at all until I find that perfect thing.

For example, when I bought my house, I went 4 years without having anything other than a one couch in the entire living room. No carpet, no side table, absolutely nothing else because I couldn't find the exact thing that I wanted that needed to be in there. 

If I see something that aesthetically grates on me, I'd rather just have nothing at all rather than having something that looks bad. 

[musical interlude]

S: We've drawn a number of parallels in this show between aesthetics, taste, fashion, and design. We keep coming back to design. It's interesting because here's a person who cares about the design of his blog, but he's also cares about what he presents to the world. He uses that to provoke a response. A response that he was provoking with his shoes and suit coat was changing the way that people treated him at this conference. 

I went to a conference recently where I dressed up as nice as I possibly could without being formal. It completely changed the way that my presentation was reacted to. I received a number of compliments and I think I'm probably going to dress up a little bit more at a conference. Put your best foot forward, as my father always used to say. Why wouldn't you?

R: I like that and I think it's appropriate. 

It's interesting, when I was at a conference just recently in Norway, I put on my best aloha shirt.

Speaking of aloha shirts… [laughing]

It's funny the reactions you get from people. They look at you and they're like, "Oh, that's neat". Well the dang thing cost me a lot of money and, to me, I'm dressed up. But who knows. I guess you don't need to be wearing a suit, is my point, to make a point with what you're wearing. 

S: Which is interesting. Do you have to spend a lot of money on design in order to provoke a response? Or do you simply just need to have attention to details? Because this is the thing that I'm hearing from both Geoffrey and Michael is that it is as much paying attention to the details. 

R: Exactly. Check out what Geoff has to say about the details and the aesthetics of his code. 

G: Thinking of something as a whole product. Thinking of not only the way it works, but the way it looks and every aspect of it. Trying to improve that overall. As developers, we want code to work, we want it to be documented well, we want a good API that we can remember and that works with the kinds of stuff we want to do with it. Often we get one or two of those. Maybe it works but the API is horrible, or maybe it has a good API but doesn't perform very well and nobody can really write that much documentation. Usually that ends up a lower priority. 

I'm coming to realize some of my aesthetic preferences for Ruby code are completely at odds, at least for most of the Ruby developers that I see regularly. I don't know a single Ruby developer who likes putting parentheses around things. I put parentheses around everything. All of Ruby developers like 'do' and 'end'. I think curly braces make much more sense everywhere. Then you can get the little editor tick back to show you the matching brace and stuff. You don't get that with 'do' 'end'.

Here's one place where I do fidget over the style is just using a code beautifier. I hate manually indenting code. Partly because then I would have to go through and fix everything to make sure it's indented the right way, because that would annoy me if stuff was oddly indented. Second, I just don't want to go through and do the work of hitting the space or tab bar until everything lines up. I just want to hit one key then BLAM, the entire file then suddenly looks beautiful. So that is one aspect where I do put my foot down and demand beauty. It's just an unbiased observation because Matz Yukihiro Matsumoto, admitted himself, uses Emacs. I assume that the way Emacs indents Ruby the way that he intends for it to be. In TextMate you can do it, too. While using TextMate exclusively, I found some little Ruby script that does some indentation.

S: Mhmm.

G: I think it's brilliant. Stuff like Google's Go comes with an indenter. You install the thing, you get a compiler, you get a debugger, and you get a code beautifier. Everybody can use that and they can know that they're using the standard style. 

R: Would you say you're a disciplined person? If you, are were you born that way or did you have to cultivate it?

G: Am I a disciplined person? I think I'm not as disciplined as I'd like to be but I think maybe that also contributes to becoming more disciplined. I feel like I always need to be more productive, need to be more consistent with things, keeping up the different habits. Good habits that I want to do regularly. That's always definitely always in the back of my mind of wanting to improve. Wanting to continue on with things. 

I'm not spending a solid month doing nothing, a blog article. It's something that I mull and maybe, as I'm drinking coffee as I wake up in the morning or something, I'm thinking about some element of this. Or I'll see some other element in a magazine or newspaper or online or something like that and think, "Oh, that's interesting, let's see if I can recreate that or let's see if I can do that".

I did a bit of skateboarding, never very good at it, but had fun. Once you start street skating it's like you're driving down town, if you're walking, if you're on the bus, you start looking around and seeing all these opportunities of, "Oh wow, there's a handrail I could go down that" or "there's something I could jump over" or "there's a flat surface of road". It's like the whole world becomes much more interesting because suddenly you have these extra capabilities, extra things that could be done. Then the world becomes just a surface on which to do these different activities. 

To me, having a blog like this is like that same kind of thing. You go around, you see elements out in the world and suddenly it becomes more than kind of a passing interest, it's something then you can take back with you and try to recreate. To me, that makes life more exciting. It gives some of the raw material to try out these different ideas.

Another thing I think, as you mentioned, that's hard is if you're writing a program, especially if you're doing test-driven development, then if you're not, you have a hard standard by which to measure whether or not the program works correctly. Which is, first, does it compile? Does it run? Then, does it do what I intended it to do? With something aesthetic, there's no real measure. 

You mentioned the golden ratio, or something. I hate it when I'm reading some book, or a talk, and people start talking about the golden ratio because they always end up with several pages about the golden ratio, what it is, and how you calculate it. Then it just kind of ends there and they go into some completely different topic. Obviously it can't be that practical because they couldn't even figure out how it would be practically applied. To me, it's just something you're generally aware of but it's not going to be a hard standard you can then measure a design by. "Oh, yea it's 5 pixels off from the golden ratio so therefore it's going to be ugly." 

I wish there were a bunch of other developers who had blogs that looked exactly like mine because, obviously, this is exactly what I want to look at. I wish more developers, definitely there are tons of front-end designers that are doing this kind of stuff, who wanted to put this kind of visual graphic attention to things because I find it interesting. It's the kind of content I want to consume. 

I subscribe to GQ and read this artorias, not that I have those kind of clothes, but I find it interesting. I think it's an attempt to create something that I think doesn't really exist out there. You know there's part of those screencasts, too, where there's something that is apparently financially viable. Let's do it, and let's do it in a way that nobody else is doing it but is completely possible and will look interesting and be useful and maybe it motivates other people to do something similar, too. 

I think the other businesses I admire are doing this sort of stuff but maybe a completely different feel. The place that I go to for coffee a couple mornings a week is this little bakery and they're doing, of course, French pastries. Flaky croissants and this sort of thing. The thing I think I admire is, the guy who started the place only a year or two ago, or something like that, he's doing this fairly small business. He's not trying to be this massive warehouse churning out millions of croissants everyday. They're back there, these artisan bakers, making these hot chili pastries or, of course, chocolate, all these different things. He's really putting this artistry into it, where everything you go and you buy from him is this delicious piece of pastry that he's put, not only effort into it technically works as it gets baked, but also tastes good and then aesthetically, that it looks interesting. Putting all those things together, that's the kind of food I like to consume, the kind of clothing I like to shop for, and the kind of blog or screencast that I want to put together to involve all those things at once. That's my model, the honorary bakery in Ballard.

S: So we know from our storytellers today that style and perception have a lot of power. It's about manipulation, sort of, and it's also about telling a story; evoking emotions in people. My question is, how many developers, how many geeks like you and I really know this and use it? We as programmers think sometimes that our primary power comes from the code. I'm starting to realize that it is as much the perception of the application as it is the application itself. 

You could have a patentable piece of amazing, PHD quality, intellectual property behind a big, fat, blue button with sharp edges on it. Will they be able to see how great your code is over that ugly button? 

Will they be able to see your brilliance over your thick beard and those New Balance shoes?

R: And that beautiful aloha shirt.

S: [laughing] And that wonderful aloha shirt.

R: And the Puka shells.

S: We may not agree that this is how it works, but there is power in style. You just have to choose how much you're going to care.
