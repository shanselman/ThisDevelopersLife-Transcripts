###Obsession
Scott: Everyone have their obsessive behaviors. They are little compulsions. You might throw salt over your shoulder. For me when I am presenting, I would like a piece of paper on the ground. It shows me my set list. Just like a band in a night bar. One time I was presenting and some friends were with me, and they would throw me off by drawing silly faces and graffiti on my set list. As I look down in my middle of presentation, I kind of got thrown away a little bit. I almost freaked out on stage, as that smiley faces and obscene things on my set list. But I made it through it. I could have imagined a Scott that could not have made it through that. Someone who would be obsessed. I know that isn’t me. We all that have that person. That inner obsessed person, that intensity that you know is inside you can’t let it get far. 
This week on This Developer’s Life, we talk about people who have a little more trouble letting go of that. First we talk to Rob Sullivan. You might remember him from a previous show. He has come back. We talk about some of his quirks and how he has taken those personality quirks of obsessive behaviors and turned them into strengths. How his boss even appreciates him even more. Next we talk to Rory Blyth. Rory is a self-confessed eccentric, who is also a talented programmer, former professional speaker and teacher. Who gets so obsessed about things he can’t understand why you are not obsessed them about as well. This is the only man I know who can diagnose a heart burner using just an equipment from an ordinary kitchen. He did that because he was reading a medical manual. Why are you not reading medical manuals too? Two acts, this week, This Developer’s Life, Obsession.

####Act One:
Rob Sullivan: My name is Rob Sullivan and I am a DBA. But don’t worry. I am not going to sit here and talk about databases. I am not going to lecture you about giving crap about parts of an application outside that help ticket you are working on. Instead I am going to talk about three letter abbreviation and I have a sneaking suspicion that more than just a couple of you are going to be nodding your head to this one. So what are those letter you might ask? You know just as I am not going to churn about the databases doesn’t mean I am not going to be a DBA. So before I give you SELECT rights to that letters, we are going to have chat to these new permissions. And lot of the episodes of This Developer’s Life we hear a lot about what pushes us or what motivates us. As developers we are trying to take this industry by the horns or in this case of episode the horn takes us. These are great topics and usually involve a lot of conscious effort on our half to take on something and see it through. And what about that part of us that we have to do something, that part of us that we jump past the meta and go straight to dogmata compulsion. That’s right the theme of my story is the sequence of letters we all are too familiar with. I am talking about O.C.D. I think practically every developer I talked to has some amount of OCD. And of course as a database guy this all flows through my blood stream (this is all that replaces my blood stream). Like say you email me a T-SQL. That’s the language I know pretty well. But unless I take and I reformat it to what my brain sees it T-SQL, I might be as well looking at some obscure language and white spaces. I am incredibly fast at it. And the funny part is that people think I am awesome at T-SQL that I can find and fix a problem in their code. Honestly, it has nothing to do with me as smart and has everything to do with me as an OCD. Like as I start taking that code and reformatting as something I could read, is a whole act of breaking it down and rebuilding it flushes out like nearly every problem. It’s like that moment when you are going after someone’s question and through the process of verbalizing that problem, you work out your own solution. But the sick part is, it is a constant struggle. Even if I find a problem and you think that I can stop there and let the person know what’s up and make a little note about a problem, I can’t stop there. And I would like continue on and keep reformatting it. And it makes no sense. Like I cannot stop reformatting this code until this gets into a happy format. And I wouldn’t care about the person’s problem. I make my note and I get it to a happy place and then I let them know that. It’s pathetic. I was trying to think of another example where just being an OCD pushed me into success. And just jolting down some things where I think I am pretty good at. And one last thing that popped up in the list is just command-line. Now I would laugh about something like writing down command-line proficiency. And secondly why and how I got to that point also cracks me up. And part of is that honestly I obsess about pretty random stuff like terminal services. Ask anybody I would work with and I am one the most annoying person about nagging about disconnected terminal services sessions. I am actually probably one of the most annoying person to work with on a lot of things. But on this issue I crank it up to a level, it just drives me nuts and I cannot get over with it. And I have to look at it and it is just something I have to do. And its crippling and I cannot move on until I find this information out. And I have this itch in my head that “Oh you must check those sessions out Rob”. And I have to do it.
(Laughs)
I think everyone that works with me, knows about it. I am very annoying in general, with some of my quirks at my workplace. But on this particular issue, I crank it up. When I see a disconnected session I have to say something to this person, why you are taking up this slots. And especially when it is a generic domain account. Like these Ops people are the worst people using there high privilege accounts, leaving them disconnected, so I cannot have to figure it out who it is and I have to dig out further from what IP address it originated from and track it down to “Dude! This drives me nut. Just stop!”
And I say to my boss “Why is that dude on that server” and he is like “What?” and “You are very proactive and like the sharpest guy in the world” and being the bridge builder that I am, and I don’t want to doubt my boss and if he is calling me sharps and I would agree with him. 
Rob Connery: When I was talking to Rob for this I couldn’t help myself and I asked him if you have left 5 terminal services sessions left open on your server right now. Talk to me about that.
Rob Sullivan: I think that the fact that I cannot form a reaction other than, and if you see them, the hairs on my arms are up as you are talking about that. And I can’t and I don’t know. Why? Why is someone on there? What are they doing? It’s a database server. It becomes an unanswerable question. And to an IT person an unanswerable questions are the hardest.
