#### Opening

Rob: Hey, Scott. Dude, I have a *great* idea - let's do a podcast. We can do a thing like [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/), and I'll loop in some groovy tunes... what do you think?

Scott: *What* are you talking about? I mean, what is this... what is this awful music? There's too much music. We should try something that sounds a little more like *[sings the [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) theme]*.

Rob: Oh come on, ok just play along. Alright, I'll get to the point. If this podcast didn't exist, and I just got you one day while you were, I don't know, installing some kind of service pack or something, and I said "Dude let's do a podcast where you riff, and I play music in the background, and we talk to people who are miserable...what do you think you would say?"

Scott: I would probably say that it's been done before, I would probably stop pronouncing my L's... and uh, honestly, really I mean I've listened to your music. I don't want to listen to your weird hippie music. I would tell you to do a podcast without the music, call it *Coneryminutes*...

Rob: Ok... you know, yeah, music, where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, your blog. Oh man, the comments on your blog every time you put up a show. But you know...

Scott: You take it too personally.

Rob: I know, I must. But you should know by now that making fun of me is painful, at least as far as you're concerned, with this show.

Scott: Yep, you are an angsty teenage girl. But I personally have had a great time, you know, listening to what you do with my voice, using the high quality professional tools like... GarageBand. Uh, seriously though... what is this music? This is a problem.

Rob: [with deep voice effect] Uh, what if the show this week is Rob playing with GarageBand while Scott brings his wife and family on, and you dump in some awful music... it's just this incredibly compelling, very emo stuff. What is the point to this show, again?

Rob: [laughing] Oh, that never, ever gets old. Ok so here's my point. I'm genuinely curious - what would you have said about my podcast pitch to you? I mean I'll tell you what I think, right? If I say to you, "Hey Scott, let's do a podcast," right, and this podcast didn't exist - you would say, "No way." I mean, you're like Mr. Geek Hollywood. How many podcasts are you on? How many recording are made of you each week, or day... each hour, right?

Scott: Maybe, I mean I probably would have been skeptical, but no more skeptical than if you'd invited me over for tacos and said, "Hey I've got a great business opportunity for you." Nobody wants to get involved in yet another failure.

Rob: You know, true. But I think you would probably have been a little more than skeptical. But alright, ok, so I'll let that go. Here's my point. You have got a squelch filter - a geek squelch filter - that is set pretty high. I mean, you know squelch filter, like the button on your kid's...

Scott: Right, right, I know what a squelch filter is. Right, increases the signal-to-noise by reducing the noise... and also the incredibly bad music, and... it filters out the nonsense, yes. No programmer is a fan of nonsense, and no one wants to waste people's time. I mean, my whole other podcast is dedicated to not wasting people's time. Like right now... I think you're about to come to your point?

Rob: Right, I get that. Ok, so to my point. How did your squelch filter get set so high?

Scott: You have to fail! I've failed a lot. I've been involved in a lot of dead end projects, deathmarches I suppose you could call them. And as you can imagine, myself... or I'm sure any kind of relatively senior engineer... hears a lot of ideas from people. You always get pitched. I'll listen to anybody for a couple of tacos, but that doesn't mean I'm going to sign in as your CTO. Like, a buddy of mine... years ago we have this joke, which is "expiredfoods.com - your B2B marketplace for food that has reached its expiration date." My buddy Joe... convinced that this is a great business idea. We all have the kind of like, "Dude... expiredfoods.com - we have to make this happen. Quit your job, move into my garage, it's going to be *awesome*..."

Rob: Ok, so of course to anybody listening now, that has a few projects under their belt, I mean of course that sounds horrible. And in fact I'm sure there are some people out there who are saying, "You know... I've actually worked on a project like that." My point being, is that now of course with hindsight, you can easily make that call. You can say, "Oh, expiredfoods.com sounds horrible." But when you're just getting started, when you just start programming... you know you're starting to build web sites, and you think "hey this is really cool." Don't you think it's a little harder to make that choice?

Scott: Because you're not jaded. You don't have the scars. If you haven't gone on a deathmarch, you don't know enough to... say "Gosh I don't think that's a good idea." You don't have the... you know how you get code smell? You develop code smell? You have to get project smell.

Rob: Exactly.

Scott: Going, "Hey, let's all go on a hike in the desert without water. That would be awesome. Let's do that." 

Rob: Well you know it's funny that you bring that up, because... so whenever you go out with geeks, I'm sure like when you go out on your Nerd Dinners, people sit around the table and they start at some point kvetching, right? Someone will lift up their geek sleeve, and say "Look at these scars *I've* got." And then, you know you start bantering back and forth... well, like these guys.

[Musical interlude]

##### Vignette: Chad Myers

Chad Myers: Quickly, they started to hire more marketing people and the requirements really just started... getting weird.

Rob: That right there is Chad Myers.

Chad: And, lo and behold we came to find out that it was a multi-level marketing scheme. And if that just sounds weird, multi-level marketing dating site, then yeah, it really was. It really was crazy. It turns out that the owner, we believed had a serious cocaine habit. And he was one of those sort of slimy, salesy... you know, he would come in and tell us we had to work at all hours of the night, which was really tough because I had just had my second child at that point, and the family was really ramping up so it was tough. He came in one time with, I don't know this for certain, but it sure looked like hookers on either arm. And he sort of flaunted them, walked up and down the aisles and flaunted them, introduced us to them and it was like Bambi and Bimbo or something... I can't remember their names. And then they went into the conference room and closed all the blinds and we heard lots of giggling, and I'm sure there was lots of grabass and stuff going on in there.

[Musical interlude]

##### Vignette: Scott Reynolds

Scott Reynolds: Wasn't able to use source control...

Rob: This is Sara Chipps talking to Scott Reynolds.

Scott R: ...because he didn't know how to *use* source control, and he wanted to be in some way involved in the code. Right, so I was just pushing my code, you know the whole xcopy source control thing, up to a central server. Well, server, whatever... it was his PC. In the meantime, I am making legitimate progress on the piece of software that he wants, and it's actually in kind of a usable form. I mean it's not like a full-featured whatever, because it's only really been like a month and I've been doing other things. But it's in pretty good shape, and I have put a lot of work into it. And he decides one day in mid-January that he is unhappy with C#.

Sara Chipps: Ok.

Scott R: Because he can't follow it, and he doesn't understand the code I'm writing. And he's been looking at it at night, and he doesn't know how to make changes.

[Pause, brief musical interlude]

Scott R: Facepalm. Start over...

Sara: [laughing] No...

Scott R: No. Yes. No, just wait. Don't even react until I say the rest of it.

[Dramatic pause with music]

Scott R: In *Access*.

[Musical interlude]

##### Vignette: Doug Rohrer

Doug Rohrer: Pretty much got the call, showed up the next Monday morning...

Rob: And this is Doug Rohrer.

Doug: And somebody kind of pulled me over to the side, and said, "Just so you're aware... we only bill 40 hours a week on this project. But we're working about 50 or 60." I don't know, it was a week or two in when we had this giant pizza party because the application would build. Not that it ran or it worked, just that it would *build*. So they had taken an existing app and kind of gutted it, and rewritten large chunks of things to make it work in a new context. It had taken them something like two or three months to get the app to just compile again. So there we were, eating pizza drinking beer, everybody's very excited about the fact that the application compiles. And I'm kind of looking around going, "What is going on?"

[Musical interlude]

Doug: Is this what enterprise projects are really like?

[Musical interlude]

Scott: Yikes, ok. That's... that's actually quite typical. I want to be like, "Oh no! I've never had that happen before." But you know, we've all had just really uncomfortable programming stories. Some of them are a lot more painful than others. You know, as you gain time and you spend more time in the industry you'll toughen up and you'll eventually decide not to do that. You'll get your project smell developed. You'll dial that thing up and you'll start saying no. I think saying no and avoiding these projects is a big part of growing up.

Rob: Yeah.

Scott: And I think that, by the time I'm 40, I think I'll have that skill.

Rob: Well absolutely, but you can't just all of a sudden have a squelch filter. You have to work a number of projects before you can decide, "I don't want to do this project." In other words, you need to have been burned at least once to understand what being burned feels like, right?

Scott: Absolutely. It's about being burned, it's about being *boiled*. Slowly. Nobody *joins* a deathmarch. No one says, "I've got this great contract in Pennsylvania. It's a deathmarch. Would you like to join our deathmarch?" No, it happens slow. You turn the heat up slow. The frog doesn't know he's getting boiled.

#### Doug Rohrer

Doug: Hmm, never tried to make Skype shut up before.

Rob: Wait, so who's this you're going to be talking to? Who's this in the background?

Scott: Ok, so this is Doug Rohrer. He's getting set up, and he and I, we sat down and we talked about a project that he was on that was literally sucking the life out of him. Check this out, this was the part that got me.

Doug: It's one of those things where you wonder, "Why am I here? Why am I doing what I'm doing?" I was away from my family for the better part of a year. I missed the first year of my son's life, basically. He was three months old when I left on this project, and I was home maybe two weekends a month if I was lucky.

Rob: Oh, man. Yeah that wouldn't work for me at all. I can't imagine for you either.

Scott: No, not a chance. Absolutely not. But you know, then again, some people have the luxury to some degree, being able to turn down projects you don't want to do. But we've all been in a situation where you're on a deathmarch, but at least it's a *paying* deathmarch.

Rob: Well Doug sounds like a really smart guy. I mean I have to think that even if he really needed a job... there has to be a line that you're not gonna cross. What keeps someone like Doug going on a project like that?

Scott: That is exactly what I asked him.

Doug: Number one, as a software developer why do I do this? Why do I allow the project to make me do these things, right? Because sometimes you don't have a choice. Sometimes it's "this is my job, and the economy right now is really bad." If I were on a deathmarch today, I probably would be carefully sending out my resume, but at the same time understanding that this is what I gotta do. And if you've got a family and a mortgage, that's what you do. But there are other reasons that people do these things. I think back then, being younger and a little bit earlier on in my career, that was certainly part of it. But there was also this "I have to prove myself to the world" kind of thing. To my peers, to my new company that I just started working with. And as horrible as the deathmarch is, there's this incredible camaraderie that comes out of it. There were 20 of us in that room, every day for a year going through this stuff. And at night we went out drinking, and played full contact darts, and just generally got to know each other really well in a way that I think is almost impossible otherwise to a certain extent.

Rob: Interesting. So Doug has this project that is driving him crazy, making him stay away from his family, he can't see his kids grow up... yet he's managed to bond with the people that he's working with. That's fascinating, I mean we all have stories like this I'm sure. In fact you do too, right?

Scott: Oh yeah, absolutely, we've all got stories like this. Mine was actually years ago. In fact when I was done talking with Doug about his, I kept the recorder rolling and I told him my story.

[Musical interlude]

##### Scott's Deathmarch

Scott: My favorite story was when we were working at 800.com And 800.com was like a pre-Amazon.com video service. And you would go up, and DVDs had just come out, I want to say this was like '99 but I'm not sure. It was early, whenever DVDs first came out. And it was running on like ISAPI and classic ASP, and we didn't have offices. We were sitting on the stairs in a marketing company, and it was just very "sleep with the servers" kind of environment. And the marketing people were just making up stuff. They were just pulling marketing square out of their butts. And one of them was like, "Hey, how about three DVDs for a dollar?" And then they just said, "Ok cool, that's a great idea" and they put it up. They didn't do any testing, they didn't do any scalability... they just said, "Let's do three DVDs for a buck." And the Internet showed up the next day. They just descended upon us. This is before Twitter, so everything spread on Usenet. You know, "Three DVDs for a dollar?" I mean it was just bananas. And what happened was, from a technical perspective, it changed the way that the site scaled.

You think about a site that is a product catalog, it is a shopping cart, and it's the checking out. So those are three aspects of a site. And you figure that 99% of people are browsing. And some small percent, one percent, two percent of people are putting things in their cart. And a percent or two are checking out. I guess that's like 104% but you get the idea. That ratio changed. Suddenly 1% of people were browsing, and 99% were trying to check out. They were trying to give us money. So our site wasn't optimized to take their money as fast as possible, and ironically they were only getting us a dollar. It literally would have been easier to just give them the DVDs for free. Because it would have taken the pressure off the shopping cart and the checkout process. But the entire web farm kind of scale got flipped on its ear, because at the time, thinking about web farms was not sophisticated. I think we were doing 40 or 50,000 concurrent users on, I don't know, 5 or 10 boxes. It wasn't big, but it was big for 10 years ago. And we were on a deathmarch then, it was like "You better get this up, you're turning away business." You know, every hour goes by we're losing business.

All the tricks that you know how to do today, we kind of figured out just on the fly. Move all your images to a different DNS server, and have them serve from a separate place. Have your shopping cart on one farm, and your product catalog on another farm. And then eventually when it got so crazy, we made the product catalog static. Such an *obvious* idea, isn't that just the thing about a deathmarch right? You look back on it and you go, "Wow, you know we could have just turned left and it would have been fine." Had we simply made the product catalog read-only, it would have taken all the pressure off of that. Which is what we ended up doing. We made the "three DVDs for a buck" pages, and all of those products and those DVDs that were eligible for that, read-only. They were like, text files.

Rob: It almost seems like this kind of storytelling is built into our DNA, like we're warriors who want to share our stories...

Scott: Oh lord, ok are we [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) now? I mean, which National Public Radio show are we going to rip off now? This is where you have like this scientist come in, and explain to us how a butterfly flaps its wings, and then a software engineer fails to compile a thousand miles away?

Rob: Ok, yeah alright you got me. I mean I love Radiolab, sure, fine... well let's just stay on track. There's something there. You hear a story, you want to respond with a story of your own. A bit of camaraderie, kind of like band of brothers.

Scott: Oh absolutely, ok I see that. In fact when I spoke to Doug about why he stayed in that project for so long, one of the things that he mentioned was exactly that.

Doug: And as horrible as the deathmarch is, there's this incredible camaraderie that comes out of it. There were 20 of us in that room, every day for a year, going through this stuff. And at night we went out drinking, and played full contact darts, and just generally got to know each other really well in a way that I think is almost impossible otherwise. To a certain extent.

Rob: I've definitely felt that. You know, you're on a team, "We'll get this done," you invent opposition if you will. Some sort of made up thing that you're fighting against as a group. A lot of managers will actively use this tactic of making you fight against the odds, to make the team band together. I mean it reminds me of something that Javier Lozano said to us in Episode 3.

Javier Lozano: There were many times when I would reach a point and say, "Damn it. We're going to be here as long as it takes." And I guess at that point, it really wasn't because of the problem. It was because I wanted to succeed. I wanted to have a win for myself and the team. I wanted everyone to say, "Yes. We tackled this together. It sucked, but you know band of brothers, we move forward, this is all great..." And it sort of builds that camaraderie, right, that every team yearns for and wants to have. And I bet you if you ask the team members now, several years after, they'll think the same way. It's like, "Yeah, we got it done. It wasn't pretty," but was it important? No. It was more important for us to do it and to build that strength around us, in making sure that, "Hey, as a team we can accomplish anything."

Scott: Sure, sure, but does that really describe the motivation? Or is that just a managerial tactic. With Doug, I mean here's a guy who's being dragged through a nightmare of a project, right? He's away from his family, his kids. He's got some camaraderie, but seriously you're not seeing your *kid*? Your *wife*? It's like a weekend per month? I mean maybe if you're in the military, but not in software development. We're not saving the world here, that doesn't add up to me.

Rob: Me neither. One thing that Doug said, however, resonated with me and seemed to add a bit to the why.

Doug: There was also this "I have to prove myself to the world" kind of thing. You know, to my peers, to my new company that I just started working with.

Rob: Which makes perfect sense to me. I mean you have your squelch dial turned to, what, 9.9?

Scott: Oh I can't even hear you, my friend.

Rob: Right, I suspected. Well you have your squelch dial set precisely because you've seen these things happen. You have the scars. But you don't when you're just getting started, which is kind of what we were talking about before. Doug seems like he is just a bit beyond getting started, he seems like he knows what he's doing. He's been around. But it also sounds like he wants to prove himself. For I don't know, what? Like upper management, a promotion? There's a lot of people that will bend their own wills, they'll do things they don't want to do, flex their family like Doug... in order to succeed.

#### Chad Fowler

Chad Fowler: Alright, I think I'm ready to go.

Scott: Ok, so who is speaking here?

Rob: This is Chad Fowler. He's a prominent figure in the Ruby community. He co-founded the [International Ruby conference](http://www.rubyconf.org/), as well as the [International Rails conference](http://railsconf.com/). Big name in the Ruby world, yadda yadda. He wrote a great post the other day that I read, about developers being stuck in [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome). You know what Stockholm syndrome is?

Scott: Right, yeah, Stockholm syndrome is when you basically fall in love with your captors. Let's put it in terms of software: you get a job, you hate your job, it's awful, it's literally torture and you're *trapped*. But after a while, your only redemption is found through those that have put you in that situation. You live for your managers, you live for the march. You know you're going to die, but you love them regardless.

Rob: Right, yeah, and I called him. Or I sent him a little email, I should say, and I said, "Well, do you have experience directly with this?" And he said, "Ohhhhh, yeah." So I asked him directly, "Why do you continue working in a deathmarch, dead-end nightmare?"

[Musical interlude]

Chad: My career started with me being a professional saxophone player who was really into Doom. And being into Doom got me into computer programming, and just computer support, which basically just opened the door to a career during the dot-com boom and all that. So, therefore I always had this feeling of being kind of an impostor. And there's actually a thing called [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), which is said to lead to Stockholm syndrome in some cases. In these sorts of cases, where impostors can't recognize their accomplishments for being their own. For me it must have been luck, because I had no qualifications. I'm working with all of these people who have all of this experience, years of experience, degrees... I have no degree, and all I had done with my life before then was study music and play music professionally.

So, coming into the situation like that, I was very impressionable. And I felt like I was just getting lucky over and over again. Maybe I didn't deserve the stuff that was happening to me, the good stuff that was happening to me. But I also probably really intensified my desire to fit in, and the whole isolation of it all. I also felt, therefore, kind of stuck. Because I didn't know if what I had done there would translate to the quote-unquote "real world." We had such a bubble, a cultural bubble there. And the perceived inability to escape a situation, even if it's not negative, is one of those four foundational situations that are said to lead to Stockholm syndrome. So I recognized that, and I didn't know it was Stockholm syndrome. I probably didn't even know that term at the time, but I recognized that I was feeling stuck. Trapped. Not in a negative situation, but I could see it becoming a negative situation if I wasn't careful. And I like to be in control of, you know, my job and my life. So I made the decision to leave that company, simply because I was too comfortable and I felt like I might be getting myself stuck later down the road.

[Musical interlude]

Scott: Interesting. Ok, well I don't think I've ever had to deal with a situation quite like *that*, but it makes sense.

Rob: Oh *really*... listen to this.

Scott: [from a previously recorded interview] You're sitting in a meeting, where you don't want to open your mouth because you're afraid that you're going to say something stupid. That sense that, "I am the stupidest person here."

Scott: Ok, right, sure. But that's Microsoft, it's a little bit different.

Rob: *Really*, I mean you don't feel like you need to prove yourself there, maybe just a bit more? I mean it seems to me that the stakes are a bit higher for you. Like, perhaps you would feel the need to take higher risks. To do things that demand more of your family, ask your family to give in a little bit more as far as time goes. Maybe moreso than when you're just starting out. I mean I know I did. I remember a few projects that... well they weren't deathmarches, but at the same time let's just say it made me feel uncomfortable. I mean I did them anyway, I knew the time demands and everything else were a little bit much. Don't you think that it's kinda the same thing?

Scott: Well... ok, let's say it this way. Developers that are, let's say early in their career, are prone to take on more risky endeavors because they want the experience. Presumably they don't have a choice... or they necessarily don't necessarily have the experience to identify that what they're getting into might be a bad idea. So I agree that the stakes can potentially get higher as your career progresses, but I disagree that you're more prone to fall into a deathmarch. I think the more experience you have, the less likely you are to do the wrong thing. So listen here to how Sara Chipps breaks down an offer for a project that she was asked to jump on recently. She recorded a segment for our show and she was in fact talking to Scott Reynolds in New York.

#### Sara Chipps

Sara Chipps: I had, I was approached by someone. I think I'm kind of spoiled, I was approached by someone a few weeks ago to work on a project. And there was a lot of red flags, he mentioned he had been through six or seven developers so far. He mentioned that he had been swindled by a few of them.

Scott Reynolds: [laughing] Oh, god.

Sara: The project had been in the process of being worked on for seven years. He had the Facebook idea before Facebook...

Scott R: Of *course* he did.

Sara: So it's the answer to Facebook, but he's never been on Facebook. Because he's angry... you know it was just a lot of things.

Scott R: That I think I would have to turn down, just on the face of it.

Rob: Yeah, If only it was that easy.

Scott: You're saying that it's not?

Rob: Sometimes not. So listen to this, I talked to Chad Myers about this just the other day. He worked for a consulting company, you know a dot-com super neat idea manager that... well here I'll let him describe this guy.

#### Chad Myers

Chad Myers: It turns out the owner, we believed had a serious cocaine habit. He was one of those sort of slimy, salesy... you know he would come in and tell us we had to work at all hours of the night, which was really tough because I had just had my second child at that point, and the family was really ramping up so it was tough. He came in one time with, I don't know this for certain, but it sure looked like hookers on either arm. And he sort of flaunted them, walked up and down the aisles and flaunted them, introduced us to them and it was like Bambi and Bimbo or something, I can't remember their names. And then they went into the conference room and closed all the blinds, and then we heard lots of giggling... and I'm sure there was lots of grabass and stuff going on in there.

Rob: Ok, so we have a manager who is *clearly* a bit of a sleazeball. I mean, why did Chad do it?

Chad: I was working as a consultant, and they put me into a dot-com startup. And I wasn't the team lead right away, but I was tapped to be the team lead shortly after. So I walked into the middle of the project, and it was already fully ramped up. I guess they were planning on hiring one or two more people, but it was in full swing. And at first it seemed like a really exciting thing. It was a dating site, an online dating site. And they were starting to do some cool stuff with Flash, and they wanted to do instant messaging inside the web application. Which was fairly new at that point, instant messaging through the web. And then they, you know, we had to do all the stuff with blocking, and you know, making sure that people couldn't harass other people.

(Stopping at 30:53)
