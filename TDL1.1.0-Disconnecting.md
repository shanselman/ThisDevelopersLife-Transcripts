[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: At any given moment, how many things are you thinking about?  Maybe work?  Something at home, with the family or friends?  What you're going to do that night?  Where you parked your car?  What your going to eat for lunch?  What you're going to make for dinner?  Whether you should go on a diet?  Maybe go to the gym?  Maybe where you're gonna go for the holidays?  Who you're gonna see?  What gifts you're gonna give?  What gifts you're going to get?  And on and on...

It's safe to say that our brains get packed, full of noise, and occasionally we get times to relax, such as the holidays.  Like right now!  Maybe you're sitting there driving along in your car; you've got your headphones on and you're listening to this podcast and you're thinking "man I really just need to unplug, to unwind, disconnect, turn those voices down".  Well good for you because that is exactly what this show is all about, it's about disconnecting.  Trying to get away from the noise, ya know?  We have two story tellers today and it's just me and Scott.  You get to follow us.  

Scott gets to do something really cool and fun, he's going to Disneyland.  You might think "hey man, that is not exactly the place to get away from the noise" but when you're with your family, smiling in the Los Angelos sun in the middle of winter, it's pretty pretty neat.

My wife on the other hand gets to go away.  I get to watch the kids for a week.  You can come with me as I am forced to unplug and stop working so much in order to be with my children.  What ultimately ends up with my deleting my Twitter account.  Yes, I did.

Stay with us.

**Rob**: 

> Daddy, Ruby's bleeding.  

So I run out of my office and I see there's blood all over the floor.  Now it's not like, pools of blood, I don't want to over exaggerate, but there's blood on the floor.  I look down and it's like footprints of blood.  There's blood everywhere. [giggles]  That's me a week ago watching my children with my wife gone and yea, that really happened.  My daughter had a blood blister on her ankle and they were playing and it popped.  I never saw it, I never even knew it was there and man, I didn't know those things had that much blood but hey it's me, Mr. Mom, watching my kids... bleeding!  What fun!

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob** So I decided to record this last week.  I was really curious what would happen with my wife being gone and the amount of work I needed to do right before the holidays because you what, everyone needs to jam stuff in right before they go off on vacation and I'm planning on taking some time off.  And I gotta tell you, it was pretty interesting, this whole process.  I captured a few of the more salient moments and I'm gonna play those for you here.  But the biggest one in my mind was seeing blood all over the floor.  My wife's not even around... Lets pick up the story from there.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: And my daughter sitting there, blood in her hands, blood on her foot and blood everywhere and I was thinking "okay it's time to go to the hospital and my wife's not here.  [giggles]  Ohh, what the fuck am I doing?  Okay, anyway."  Well I know a number of our listeners
don't have children, but you will someday and believe me seeing blood anywhere near your child is pretty much the most traumatic thing.  It sends you right into orbit, believe me.  Anyway, I don't wish that on anyone, but let's rewind the tape a bit, that's not exactly where the story started.  That was about the third day into it, so let's go back to the very very beginning.

So I'm standing here in my driveway just as my wife pulled away to go to the airport.  Uhh, this is going to be an interesting week for sure.  And what's kinda funny is, I watched her car pull away and I was thinking to myself, "can I really do this?"  I mean of course I can; this isn't my first time alone with my children but the problem is that I'm really, really, really busy with work and I'm gonna have to juggle a lot.  I mean it's really hard anyway when your spouse goes away and you have 2 kids, you gotta deal with it, but I'm looking at this like an opportunity to like, disengage.  Um, it's gonna pull me away from work and I need that because I work way to much.  I stay downstairs and my wife will have dinner ready upstairs, I'll come blasting upstairs for enough time to eat something, put them to bed and sometimes I'm back to work and other times, maybe, well I'll be lucky and I don't.  But, this will be good.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: I'm sitting at my desk; this is weird.  Uh my wife is... she works at home, just like I do but we both have offices here in our house.  We both are able to and office and uh, she works out of the house as do I.  And uh, she's not here, and it's weird because the house is always bustling with something.  I mean she's moving up and down the stairs, she's seeing patients, she does acupuncture.  And there is voices always, there's some kind of activity, it's either her or the children, but it's so quiet.  I'm just not used to that.  But it's kind of nice.

So I just checked my calendar here.  I use Google's calendar and it syncs with my phone.  I've put in all of the times I have to be somewhere for the kids and my god, this is crazy.  I had no idea just how much.. I mean for instance, both of them they go to a different school so they start and they get out at different times and one of them has a short day this week and the other has ballet lessons and oh my goddness, [giggling] how am I going to do this?

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: Alright well it's lunch time and I've been reasonably productive.  It's kind of funny, I spend so much time on Twitter.  And uh, you know reading emails and so on, I've had to shut it off because I know that I got to get up at two and get out of here.  And, well it's two. I'm sitting here staring at a billing problem that I'm trying to fix for Tekpub and I can't finish it.  I have to walk away and you know my partner, my business partner, James Avery, is on Skype and we're talking about all the things we can do once we finish the billing system.  And there's like a mountain of things that, I can't do it.  I've got to get up and walk away.  I'm exposed[not-sure], that is part of the deal.  [door slamming noise] Whoops slammed the door.  I guess that's part of the deal.  I have to be able to get up and disengage.  So anyway, I'm talking as I'm walking here because I've got to go.  I'm already late.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: I like to think of myself as an optimistic person and well I know I went into this week thinking "this will be pretty easy weekend, I'll get to hang with my kids a little bit more, disengage from work... you know I'll just have to adjust."  And while that last part, "I'll just have to adjust", well it's not that simple.  I own a business that I have to maintain.  I also have to do this podcast which I very much enjoy and I have a couple contracts on the side.  Just turning off isn't that easy.  The good news is, that within no time, I am reminded of why I am doing this.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob's child**: When ever I run, my pants keep falling down.

**Rob**: [giggling] That happens to me all the time too.

Okay, well we're out in the back yard.  We're playing.  This is fun.  I can't lie and tell you that I don't think I have tons of stuff to do but...

Hey is that some kind of fort or... what are we doing? 

**Rob's child**: What do you mean?

**Rob**: I mean what's this whole, like...

**Rob's child**: We're giving gifts to each other.  Like Ruby gave me that wood full of flowers.

**Rob**: Ohh sweet

**Rob**: So just to set the scene here a little bit, my kids have this ornate decoration on the little deck that's right outside of our bedroom and it's in these crazy patterns.  They got banana leaves and coconut husks and little twigs and sticks all done up in this crazy pattern and they've grabbed some of their animal figures and arranged them just so into like little beds and little buildings and stuff.  It's this whole big thing they've whipped out of nowhere within minutes.

**Rob's child**: Well I just gave her the wood and the flowers all separated.

**Rob**: That's very nice.  I see you got your pants back up. [giggling]

**Rob's child**: Every time I run my pants fall down, even when I'm like all the way over there by Pua, when she got dead. [child giggling]

**Rob**: Pua is the cat that we had.  Got run over by a car and we buried her in our back yard.  

**Rob**: [laughing at children]

**Rob's child**: ...and...

**Rob**: My sensitive sweet daughter.

**Rob's child**: ...and I got this.

**Rob**: Oh, that's a really cool coconut husk.  You found that over by Pua?

**Rob's child**: mmhmm.

**Rob**: Cool.  Well what are you doing with it?

**Rob's child**: Whenever I run back, my pants fall down up to here.

**Rob**: Maybe it's Pua's ghost pulling your pants down.

**Rob's child**: Noooo..... [very exaggerated]

**Rob**: [giggling]  Yea, what billing system?

[Musical Interlude]

[Sounds of pounding rain]

**Rob**: Do you guys see how much it's raining outside?  Wow!  Oh here it comes again.  I.. cannot see.. I mean I can see the road.  But it's like, yea it's really good.  I can see the road, but it's like a haze or a fog covering the surface of the road and it's just splashing water.  And I'm driving at night.  I don't normally drive at night.  There's no street lights here, so it's pitch black.  It is really loud.  Now it's coming down again.  Wow! Man!  It's really trippy being on the road.  What do you think Rubes?

**Ruby**: WHOA!  IT'S RAINING!  THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, YAY!

**Rob**: What do you think the thunder and lightning do?

**Ruby**: Bad stuff.

**Rob**: Bad stuff?

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: In case you're wondering, don't worry I had my recorder sitting right next to me, I wasn't holding it, so I wasn't in any danger, but man that rain storm was insane!  I live on the north side of Kaua`I which is an island in the Pacific Ocean, in the state of Hawaii and it rains here an awful lot.  In fact, we hold the record for most rainfall anywhere.  It's the wettest place anywhere in the world.  When it rains, man my kids _love it_.  And we go outside, or they go outside sometimes in their bathing suits and just run around.  Well this happened to be a tropical storm with lots of thunder and lightning.  So it was pretty fun to experience that with my kids.  But right before the storm hit, we had a period of calm and it was great because, well, I got to go out and experience the coast line in a way that I haven't for a really long time.

I'm here at the Kilauea lighthouse.  I have an hour to kill, my kids are at an art class that they take after school one day per week.  So I have an hour to kill, and this is hard because I'm used to working.  I'm not used to just stopping in the middle of the day and it's frustrating but I'm trying to fill it with something.  And I remember just sitting there trying to think of what to do.  It's a whole hour, plus, that I have to wait.  It's like three o clock in the afternoon and I'm stressing out thinking like I gotta go back and uh, I gotta go back at like four something and then work until five something and then I gotta make dinner.  That's not easy but I'll tell you what, sitting here, looking at the blue ocean, if you ever come Kaua'I, make sure you come to Kilauea, to the lighthouse right here at the end of the road looking over the blue water.  There is no wind today.  And there's whales!  There are like 4 or 5 whales.  I see them cruising around out there and blowing their spouts.  Feeling the sun.  Hearing the people quietly talk that are out here on vacation, not thinking about work.  It's sort of pulling my head out of it.  It's pretty difficult.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: Okay, I've been here for 45 minutes.  That was cool.  I uh, I didn't even realize it.  Sitting here looking at the birds.  A bunch of whales came by.  There was a squall that just blew through.  And uh, I didn't even realize it.  That's kinda fun.  I gotta get my kids.  I gotta do this tomorrow.  This is neat.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: You know, one of the things I didn't expect this whole week was just how much fun it was to just pick up my kids everyday.  I usually drop them off at school but you know I'll just drive up and kinda take them in, pretty early in the morning, because as I mentioned I have work to do.  But picking them up, all the parents just hangout.  They sit and talk to each other.  They say hi.  You get to know the moms and the dads and meet people you normally don't talk to very much.  You get to know their kids a little bit better.  It's almost like a full social circle in itself.  Which is uh, pretty amazing considering the social circle that I was about to give up.  So I should probably preface this story a little bit.  This week got to me and the time that I spent at the lighthouse in particular.  I went there every single day and I only recorded one day because I really wanted to enjoy it.  The feeling of the sun and the air and the waves in the middle of the day when I'm always, always working.  It was a neat feeling to be away, and to spend time with my children of course.  Anytime you spend time with your children like that it just strengthens the bond and you kinda realize these kids are way bigger than I thought they were.  When was the last time I checked in like this?  The thing that really got me was picking them up from school everyday and getting to know the parents and the families that my kids spend time with every day.  When you contrast that with what I do socially everyday on twitter, you know, or on my blog, kind of in the internet virtual landscape if you will and you kind of think, what have I traded here?  And I spend a lot of time on twitter and a lot of time it derails me completely from my work, where I end up working later because I've spent more time on twitter.  I've actually lost money, literal... I can actually tell you a dollar amount that I've lost because of twitter and I know a lot of people have the same kind of story.  So I don't want to go off, this is my personal take on what twitter has done to me.  At least here locally.  And I don't know these people as well as I should.  I want to know them better.  I want to know my kids better.  I want to go upstairs earlier.  I want to stop losing money and stop losing time.  Well anyway that led me to what happens next.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: I'm sitting here at my computer.  I feel like I'm breaking up with a girlfriend.  You know that feeling you get when you feel like a relationship is finished and you're like I gotta do it; I gotta make this phone call.  I'm going to deactivate my twitter account.  I have 7,000 followers.  I guess that's neat.  I don't know what to think of it.  Okay I'm gonna go it.  Put this down right here.  Look at that, there's a link right there.  De-act-ivation.  Done.  No more twitter.  Wow.  No more twitter.  Okay, that's, it's... the sun is still out.  The rain is still falling.  There's still oxygen in the room.  Oh my god, the world didn't stop.  Okay, well lets see what happens now.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: I don't really expect everyone to understand just why I deleted my account.  For a lot of people, twitter works and hey this is a very personal decision.  I don't think it is one that everyone needs to make, but you know what?  If you're having trouble connecting with your family, you find you've got more time spending online worrying about things people are thinking or doing that hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles away from you, people that you might have not ever even met in person, if you've never looked into their eyes, then maybe you need to ask yourself "what is that worth versus the friends and family that I have around me"?  Again for me, it wasn't worth it at all.  And I have to tell you I am very much enjoying the absence of twitter in my life.  Sitting here on the road next to a beach called middles and it's in the middle of Hanalei Bay and there's a reef that's about a quarter mile out where the waves break just wonderfully and today's just one of those days where you got a swell and the wind is stopped.  The water is completely glass.  I've just surfed for two and a half hours and this is something I don't do.  I mean sometimes I take a lunch break and I'll come out and surf for a bit but it's usually just 45 minutes and in the back of my mind the whole time is "I gotta get back, I gotta go work, I gotta finish that thing and when I finish that thing, I have another thing, there is always another thing to finish".  Today, I just stayed out there.  And one of the things that's so cool about disconnecting, especially turning off twitter, is the voices in your head go quiet.  There is nothing out there that was telling me go go go!  That billing system that I've been stressing about is still not done.  James doesn't care.  The world's not coming to an end.  I can go home and finish it.  If I don't finish it today I'll finish it tomorrow.

I know that I'm lucky to live near a beach.  But I sacrificed a lot to get here because I want to be here.  I'm sure that you live in a place that you want to live.  If you can't get to the beach, well hey get on your bike.  Go for a ride.  Go for a long walk where there's trees.  Maybe go for a walk at night under the stars.  Go with your family, go with a close friend.  Maybe hang out with your cat in a quiet place.  Light a fire.  Read a book.  There's lots of things you can do to unplug and disconnect.

[Musical Interlude]

**Rob**: Scott's up next to take in one of the first vacations he's had in years, with the family, off to Disney Land to unplug and disconnect.

[Automated warnings for a roller coaster]

**Scott**: This week on This Developer's Life the audio will be a little bit more guerrilla as I'm recording portably.  I'm trying to disconnect.  We're gonna go to Disney Land and uh, I'm going to try to not be on twitter and not be on email and not check my email constantly.  It's a little chaotic over here and the idea is that I would pay a little bit more attention to the kids and little bit less attention to work.  

I don't know if you can hear the kids in the background.  I think that the pirates are fighting the ninjas or ninjas are fighting the pirates or something but we need a vacation so we're going on vacation.  This is the first vacation in a couple of years.  The last vacation was Africa I think two years ago, three years ago and my wife Mo says that I'm just too connected.  I spend to much attention to the computer and too little attention to the kids so I'm gonna try to explore this addiction and we're gonna start by exploring it in Disney Land.
