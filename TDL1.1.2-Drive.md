	-Nate and Niki Kohari

#### Opening: 

Rob:  In our last episode, Scott, Sarah and I talked to some developers about the worst projects that they've ever been involved in.  They all seemed to share a common theme.  

Nate Kohari:  He decides one day, in mid-January, that um, he is unhappy with C sharp, because he can't follow it, and he doesn't understand the code I'm writing.  Start over...

Niki Kohari:  No

Nate:  No.  Yes...

Niki:  [laughs]

Nate:  In Access.

Niki:  [laughing in background]

Nate:  He came in one time with a, uh, ya know, I don't know this for certain, but it sure looked like hookers on either arm.  And he sort of flaunted them, walked up and down the aisles, flaunted them, ya know, introduced us to them, you know, and it was like Bambii and Bimbo, or something, I can't remember their names. 

[Musical Interlude]

Rob:  And then somehow, I got pulled into this.

Scott:  Yesterday you told me that you cashed in your 401(K) to do this.  And now I can see, see you ending up in a story like this.  You hired someone to do TekPub with you, heh heh, flaunting around the office with hookers an your'e doin coke off the desk, presumably on a Macintosh.  You know, when you risk, when you risk that much you, Rob, are now the unstable, weird manager guy.

[Musical Interlude]

Rob:  The unstable, weird, manager guy.  How's does that happen to a person?  Are you born that way?  Or do you slowly wack out over time.  Being an entrepreneuer, risking it all, isn't easy.  It does different things to different people.  Today we're gonna take a look at those things, take a look at the forces involved when you make risky decisions.  Episode twelve of This Developer's Life.  Drive.

[Musical Interlude]

Dave Nielsen:  It was, it was New Year's Eve, and I'd gone out with my friends, we actually had a decent time.  Then it was like two in the morning and I knew I was gonna have to deal with this, so um, I had this couch all scoped out that was in the basement and I know that the, I have the key and the way to get in and all tht kinda stuff because we were already out of our office, and um,  so I found my way into where the storage was and slept on the couch.  I think I slept there lke two nights.

[Musical Interlude]

Tom Preston-Werner:  Why wouldn't you want to work at GitHub if we offer you a job?  Who knows, five years from now, we're making a ton of money in revenue every year.  Why can't we be one of the only companies that has ever IPO'd without taking investment?

Nate:  I don't, I don't think I would have been able to take the product and turn it into a business without Nik. That's what she was really able to, you know, make work.  Yea, it would never have worked, I'm convinced of that.  

Niki:  [laughs]

Nate: I'm not sayin' that just cus' she's sittin' next to me.  I would theorize that it's actually simpler in a lot of ways, um, if the business partners are married.

[Musical Interlude]

Scott:  Alright now, that was three interesting segments, but that first segment there... uh, he's sleeping in his garage.  That uh, let's just say that stands out a little bit.

Rob:  Ha ha, that's my friend Dave Nielsen.  Serial entrepreneur with about five different projects going all at once.  Did you ever see that movie, "Rushmore"?

Scott:  Of course, of course.  This is the movie that actually made Jason Schwartzman's career.  Who, you know, we've seen him in everything.  He's in iPad and New Yorker advertisments, and he's on TV all the time.  And in the movie, his character, he's this high school kid.  But that he wants to be involved in everything.  

Rob:  Yep

Scott:  He's got awful grades but he's in every club in school.  Backgammon club, and French club, and he even starts a little group called the Max Fischer Players.

Rob:  Exactly.  Everytime, it's funny, everytime I try and describe Dave, uh, to a friend that hasn't met him, Max pops right in my head. 

[Movie Clip Plays]

Man: What's the secret Max?

Max:  The secret?

Man:  Yea, well, you seem to have it pretty figured out.

Max:  Gee, I dunno, uh... I think you just gotta find something you love to do and then do it for the rest of your life.  For me, it's going to Rushmore.   

[End Movie Clip]

Scott:  Alright, well, I think this is gonna be a good one. I need to hear how this guy ends up sleeping in the storage space of his office.

Rob:  Yea, I never get tired of hearing this.

[Musical Interlude]

Dave:  Yea, it was pretty crazy.  That was definitely rock bottom, uh, at least so far, and I really hope I never go anywhere near that again.  Um, I had, it was a series of ridiculous events.  My girlfriend and I at the time, we were having a litle bit of trouble but we wanted to make it work, and so I moved out of my apartment and into her apartment, uh, across town.  And at the same time, like 9/11 had just happened, and, um, the business was struggling.  It was just a tough time and the fact that my girlfriend and I moved in together is probably what broke us up.  It kinda made us realize that this just wasn't going to work.  And I'd already rented out my apartment, so I was, I had no place to go.  

Dave:  And at the same time the business was tanking, so since I didn't have much money, I just took the opportunity to live out of the office, the loft.  And I lived there for like three months and I then had to get rid of that place because the rent was too high.  So I moved into another little office space that was like two tiny rooms, and I remember there was, in the transition, a period where I literally had no place to live.  I had the one place with clothes and the other wasn't available for a few days so I was literally, uh, hiding out in the basement of the office building that we had been renting.  

Dave:  It was embarrassing, quite frankly, just on myself. I thought, I am, it was New Year's Eve, because that was when the lease was up, the end of December.  I had gone out with my friends, we actualy had a decent time.  Then it was like two in the morning and I knew I was gonna have to deal with this, so um, I had this couch all scoped out that was in the basement and I know that the, I have the key and the way to get in and all tht kinda stuff because we were already out of our office, so I found my way into where the storage was and slept on the couch.  I think I slept there lke two nights.  It was kinda a dungeon-y like place.  It just felt [sigh], uh man, I felt homeless.  I felt like

Rob:  Well, you were homeless

Dave:  Oh, I know, technically, I was homeless for a couple of days.  Yeah.

[Musical Interlude]

Dave:  You know what's really funny about this too is that I did have a car, so I guess I could have slept in my car.  But the uh, funniest thing is that before I moved into the new office, like a couple of days later, well, I should say, while I was moving into the new office, my car was stolen. [Laughs]  uh, my God... So I remember I didn't have a place to stay, my car was stolen, and it, it was just... One of my friends said, "Dave, you know, it cannot get worse than this.  This **IS** rock-bottom."

[Musical Interlude]

Dave:  That was, uh, definitely etched, it etched a, a sort of like a mark.  A low mark, in my life and in my career that I never wanted to go back to.  

Rob:  So the funny thing is, I've known Dave probably longer than most any friend I have.  We grew up two blocks from each other in Los Angeles, uh, met while we were in grade school, and uh... You know the funny thing, I ran against the guy, uh, for student body vice-president, believe it or not.

Scott:  I am, I am disturbed that you still remember this.  You are still hanging on to high school so many years later, but more importantly, who won the election?  

Rob:  Me of course, why would you ask?  

Scott:  [Laughs] I'm not surprised.  I'm not surprised.  I should have known better than to ask, uh, but still more importantly, Dave.  How is Dave doing now? 

Rob:  He's doing really well.

Dave:  I'm the found of CloudCamp.org, and it is a series of events that we put on around the world to help educate both developers, techies, and uh, non-techies about cloud computing.  And, I also have a consulting company called Platform D where I help companies market their technologies to other technology people, like web developers.  And I get my background in this area from being a developer myself through the nineties, um, running a web services user group for ten years now, and uh, having a job at PayPal where I ran their, or I was their first technical evangelist and eventually ran the PayPal Developer Network.   

Rob:  So Dave is one of the most tenacious, ah, people I've ever known, if it's not clear by now.  It's actually kind of ridiculous.  Uh, again coming back to, uh, Max, uh, as you said, Max doesn't care, Max never cared about his grades.  He's purely focused on the school as a social system.  And Dave is somewhat the exact same way.  Um, he's the kind of friend you have, well he's one of those guys you you tell stories about.  What's Dave doing?  What's Dave going to do? Uh, it's, he's a laugh riot.  And you know, so, so for example, he goes to Cal-Poly San Luis Abispo, in northern California, and he wanted to join a fraternity.  Uh, they didn't have a fraternity that he liked, so guess what the guy does?  

Scott:  Okay, so he couldn't find a fraternity he liked, he made up his own fraternity.

Rob:  Exactly right.  He goes and he founds Pi Kappa Alpha, the Pikes.  It's a pretty well known fraternity.  Uh, yeah, and the guy founds a fraternity, ya know, and he goes back to San Luis Abispo, he's treated like a king.  At the frat house. 

Scott:  Wow, that's impressive.  Okay, so he's a force, he's a force of nature.  Does what he wants, uhh, you know, and presumably he does this without any fear.  Seems like the perfect employee.  I assume he has the history of working for himself.  
Rob:  You got that right. 

[Musical Interlude]

Dave:  I thoroughly enjoy working for myself and the freedom and the creativity, but it, if, if the right type of project or company came along that just seemed really cool, umm, you know, or fit in with what I want to accomplish in life, I certainly have no, uh, problem with that.  It's not the fact that i want to work for myself that drives me, it's that I want to do something that I enjoy and that I'm passionate about.  And unless a company comes along that has a job and a product and a service that I feel passionate about, then, uh, I probably won't take it.  You know if there was some technology that I felt very confident in, something around cloud computing or web services, that I thought was an incredible opportunity to make a big difference in the developer community, which is the community that I care alot about.  Uh, or, you know, maybe just the general public, umm, I'd consider it.  You know, it'd have to something pretty innovative and game-changing. Uhm, I would really, I, I can't imagine myself just working for a company that's done the same thing for the last ten years.
